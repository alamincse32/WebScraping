construction site safety signage transportation plastics can make trains buses boats planes atvs and rvs safer more comfortable and more fuel-efficient thanks to their durability and decreased weight in the event of a collision some polymers are impact- and fire-resistant which better protects passengers and drivers for everyday comfort plastics can also provide sound dampening effects which provides a more pleasant experience for passengers and commuters plastics can also provide clear communication and attractive interiors inside commuter vehicles due to the wide variety of colors and

windows window graphics folding trays wall panels driver security glazing bus driver clear barrier atv windows airline windows safety & security polymers can be highly effective in protecting people from natural disasters and attacks from physical assault bullets and bomb blasts fabricated plastics can be used in wearable armor and safety barriers unlike glass plastics have the ability to absorb shock by converting the energy of an impact into heat which allows the polymer material to bend rather than shatter security plastic is also more energy efficient than safety glass so when used for barriers such as bank windows and detention center glazing it can lower the business or institution’s carbon footprint featured parts: safety & emergency signs bank windows convenience store/gas

13,engineered plastics for heavy equipment industry cope plastics heavy equipment engineered plastics are an excellent alternative to traditional metal components in construction agricultural and mining equipment the unique physical characteristics of a wide variety of materials provide a performance advantage in the rugged requirements of heavy equipment heavy equipment pain points wear life lubrication reduction corrosion & abrasion resistance weight reduction wear life the low coefficient of friction and inherent wear resistance of engineered plastics have proven to increase part life in demanding applications these materials are also non-abrasive to mating surfaces improving the wear life of the metallic components as well lubrication reduction the sliding characteristics of engineered plastics and the enhanced surface lubricity offered by internal fillers can reduce or in some cases eliminate the need for additional lubrication corrosion & abrasion resistance engineered plastics do not rust they exhibit good uv resistance and they are unaffected by a wide variety of chemicals abrasion resistance is also very good enabling the materials to be used in extremely dirty environments weight reduction engineered plastics have an excellent strenh to weight ratio providing fuel economies decreased compaction and lower structural stress secondary industries agricultural equipment plastic parts have long been preferred over metal parts in the agriculture industry where weight reduction and lubricity are the primary concern lighter weight plastic parts increase equipment’s fuel efficiency and ease of operation and self-lubricating material eliminate the need to add grease and grime to the field plastics are also corrosion and shatter resistant making them ideal for outdoor applications cope plastics fabricates many different parts for tractors harvesting equipment implements silage and other types of agriculture equipment popular parts include wear

landfill waste meet global demands create new job sectors and economic growth be proactive to governmental regulations lessen costs of goods be socially and environmentally responsible and to preserve our planet—we only have one how do performance plastics get recycled through reprocessing companies many performance plastics are pelletized ground washed compounded sorted and packaged to be used as an economically viable alternative to virgin resin or pellets and made into new products how can i better ensure that my scrap performance plastics are desirable keeping different material types sorted and labeled is important as well as storing scrap indoors and avoiding potential contaminants like machine chip wood and metal debris dirt oil hardware and vinyl graphics as they may all downgrade recyclability masking is acceptable on most materials but may also reduce appeal does demand for performance plastics vary depending on material type yes similar to metal markets there is a broad range of desirability and marketability for polymer materials types that are recycled domestically into electronic housings such as polycarbonate and abs are in high demand while those that are difficult or dangerous to reprocess like pvc and acetal are not can performance and engineering plastics be considered sustainable or environmentally-friendly yes in order for a product or material to be truly described as sustainable it must be environmentally economically and socially sustainable plastics make an immense contribution to environmental sustainability through their energy-saving
