16,our history trail king industries our history 1974 gordon and shirley thomsen founded western ag sales in 1974 during the first few years the company was primarily a distributor and sales representative for manufacturers of agricultural equipment 1978 in 1978 western ag sales purchased another mitchell-based manufacturing company plains industries and moved into their manufacturing facility with this purchase western ag also brought a new line into their product offerings called “trail king” during the next few years western ag expanded this line to include trailers with many enhanced features to better meet customers specific hauling needs such as hydraulic tails and detachable goosenecks the most notable feature was trail kings development of what many at the time considered the best hydraulic detachable gooseneck in the industry: a system that made hooking up and unhooking a simple one-person 60-second connection as the 1970s ended the companys emphasis shifted away from the distribution of ag-related equipment to focus exclusively on manufacturing trail king trailers 1983 western ag sales officially changed its name to trail king industries in 1983 this focus on trailers led to an expanded product line these trailers were designed to address construction-related applications and to meet the needs of the commercial and specialized hauling markets along with this product line expansion came increased sales which naturally lead to increased production capability demands to address this need trail king built a new manufacturing plant in 1987 this new 67500 square-foot plant helped meet the ever-increasing demand for trail king trailers 1995 the plant was expanded in 1992 when sales continued to grow straining production capacity two years later it was expanded again after trail king acquired assets of ti-brook inc today our facilities in mitchell stand at 295000 square feet they provide state-of-the-art production capabilities for a workforce of over 450 employees 2000 in 2000 trail king further expanded their product offerings after purchasing red river manufacturing based in west fargo nd red river had a well-deserved reputation for manufacturing outstanding live bottom and bottom dump trailers for the agricultural waste and construction industries with the 2007 construction of a brand new 160000-square-foot facility it further increased trail kings ability to meet market demand in an even more timely efficient and quality manner 2010 trail king was acquired by cc industries inc cci in 2010 this acquisition expanded ccis portfolio of leading industrial manufacturers and transportation equipment companies it also afforded trail king the expertise and support necessary to enhance trail kings long-term strategic growth as north americas leading specialized trailer manufacturer 2015 in may 2015 trail king expanded its product offerings and its production capacity when they acquired dakota trailer manufacturing located in yankton sd dakota trailers produced aluminum grain hopper trailers for the agriculture market these trailers have complemented trail kings existing line of live bottom agriculture trailers that are manufactured at its west fargo facility 2021 in march 2019 our plant in west fargo sustained irreparable damage due to a collapsed roof after a massive snowstorm the decision was made to fast forward a plan to expand and improve the property a new building was finished in the summer of 2021 2022 despite our growth and change—and all that surely lies in our future—we will continue to hold the same values and mission we will always strive to lead the way in the trailer industry delivering trailers that are engineered and manufactured to the highest standards of quality performance and reliability we will continue to participate in organizations whose missions are to elevate the trailer industry and its related industries to new levels of innovation professionalism and integrity chat with us powered by livechat
