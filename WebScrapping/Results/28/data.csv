the row finder also has a backup feature that allows you to back up without lifting the machine or damaging the row finder active depth control adc on amity technology harvesters is a key component in reducing tare and maximizing root yield as harvester widths have increased the need for leveling and depth control has emerged adc continuously monitors digging depth on both sides and adjusts rear

features patented live wall chains to help with unloading the cart uses four hydraulic remotes for the tank lift cylinders and front/rear chains for maximum control over the dump rate crop chaser 2000

multi crop uses silage/forage crops silage/forage crops grains grains sugar beets sugar beets crop chaser dump carts are a highly versatile option to improve the logistics of many harvest operations silage/forage crops grain sugar beets specialty crops beets sweet corn edible beans & much more improved logistics / increased road safety one cart load equals one truck load in most cases crop chaser carts keep trucks at the headlands of the field crop chaser carts add reliability and consistency to harvest operations by keeping trucks out of the field crews can run more consistently with fewer weather delays furthermore one cart load equals one truck load in most cases helping to improve the flow of trucks running to the storage site additionally when trucks are used in the field they often track mud onto public roads creating safety and liability issues tractors pulling traditional carts cause the same problems when they’re used to transport the product back to the farm crop chaser carts keep trucks at the headlands of the field helping to prevent them from dragging large amounts of mud onto the road light footprint tracks significantly reduce compaction standard camso 36-by-136-inch tracks the standard 36-by-136-inch tracks on the crop chaser dump carts reduce compaction by providing a much lighter footprint than trucks or carts with wheels thanks to the track

valves load holding valves left- or right-hand dump left- or right-hand dump work lights & cameras work lights & cameras 36″ x 136″ tracks crop chaser dump carts feature industry-leading camso tracks which are rated for speeds up to 20 miles per hour 32 kph the 36-by-136-inch tracks minimize compaction and are much better suited for use in wet conditions than competitive carts with tires when fully loaded the 1000 series only exerts 160 psi while the 2000 series exerts 145 psi assuming a load of 80000 pounds on the 1000 series cart and 66000 pounds on the 2000 series with 8% load on the hitch on-board scale integrated scales improve logistics by eliminating the need for trucks to run over a scale before dumping three sensors one on each track and one on the hitch provide a highly accurate weight measurement of each load ground accessible greasing locations grease zeros are all reachable from the ground making routine maintenance quick and easy with no hard-to-reach locations load holding valves special load holding valves provide added safety by preventing the load from moving in case of an unforeseen hydraulic issue left- or right-hand dump customers can order either model with a left- or right-hand dump the modular design of these carts also allows the dump side to be flipped later in the shop work lights/cameras work lights provide excellent visibility in times
