This information is current as of the date of the Notice and is applicable in the 12 months preceding the last revised date of the Notice. If you are a California resident, please see our âNOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTSâ section below. For other state residents, your privacy rights may include (if applicable): The right to confirm whether or not we are processing your personal information and to access such personal information; The right to obtain a copy of your personal information that we collected from and/or about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; The right to delete personal information that we collected from and/or about you, subject to certain exceptions; The right to correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions; The right, if applicable, to opt out of the processing of your personal information for purposes of (1) targeted advertising; (2) the âsaleâ of your personal information (as that term is defined by applicable law); and (3) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you; If we are required by applicable law to obtain your consent to process sensitive personal information, the right to withdraw your consent; and The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights. Requests you make regarding your personal information collected and retained may be subject to certain exceptions. For example, Schwanâs cannot delete your personal information if it is being used as a part of a current contract or transaction. Schwanâs will inform you of such exceptions in its response to your request. Depending on how the applicable privacy law defines a âsale,â we may sell personal information to third parties. For instance, if you are a resident of Colorado or Connecticut, our use of cookies and tracking technologies constitutes a sale of personal information to third-party advertisers. Please note, Schwanâs does not sell, re-sell, distribute for re-sale, or share your personal information except where our use of website tracking technology equates to a âsaleâ of personal information. We also use cookies and other tracking technologies to display advertisements about our products to you on nonaffiliated websites, applications, and online services. This is âtargeted advertisingâ under applicable privacy laws. We do not use personal information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning individuals MAKING A REQUEST AND VERIFICATION If we receive a request from you, we will first make a determination regarding the applicability of your stateâs law, and we will then take steps to verify your identity prior to responding. The steps to verify your identity may vary based on our relationship with you, but, at a minimum for your protection, Schwan's is required to collect certain information from you to verify your identity before we respond to any request submitted by you. To verify any request or exercising of rights described here, you will be required to provide information to verify your identity (e.g., name, address, and e-mail address). Failure to do so could result in Schwan's inability to comply with your request. The information you provide to verify your identity will only be used for verification purposes, and a record of your request, including certain information contained within it, will be maintained by Schwan's for its files. If you would like to exercise your privacy rights and make a request as described here, please use the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION and contact Schwan's. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may make requests regarding your data one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to two times a year, free of charge. However, Schwanâs may charge a reasonable fee or deny a request that is considered manifestly unfounded or excessive. Schwanâs will respond to your request within 45 days. If for any reason your request is denied, Schwanâs will provide a âno actionâ explanation within the 45-day period. If your jurisdiction offers you a right to appeal such denial, you will be informed of your right to appeal that decision. For residents of certain states,Â your rights as stated here can also be exercised by an authorized agent on your behalf. Where a state law, regulation, or regulator has described the process for establishing an authorized agent, Schwanâs will follow the standards set by that state law.Â For example, the Attorney General of California has set certain standards regarding designation of an authorized agent to exercise rights under Californiaâs privacy legislation, which you may review to ensure you are submitting a compliant request. Schwan's can deny any request made by an agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized by a resident to act on that resident's behalf. NON-DISCRIMINATION FOR EXERCISING PRIVACY RIGHTS Under the privacy law of certain states, residents of those states have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Schwan's or any business for the exercise of their privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain privacy rights by those residents may make it so that Schwan's is no longer able to provide those residents with certain aspects of the Offerings. For example, if, at the request of a California resident, Schwan's deletes all of the California resident's personal information that it maintains, Schwan's will no longer be able to send marketing communications to that resident unless that resident re-submits personal information to Schwan's. NO SALE OF INFORMATION As previously stated, except as may be defined uniquely by state privacy laws, Schwan's has not, in the last 12 months, sold your information, nor does Schwan's have plans to sell your information in the future. DO NOT TRACK âOpt-Out Preference Signals,â âGlobal Privacy Control (GPC),â and âDo Not Trackâ (âDNTâ) are browser settings and/or downloadable signals that allow users to notify websites of an individualâs privacy preferences. For example, DNT is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites you visit that you do not wish to be tracked. Such browser settings must be supported by the website you are visiting to be effective. Currently, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to these signal. As such,Â SchwanâsÂ is not currently able to support such browser codes, and Schwanâs will not automatically acknowledge and/or respond to your particular settings when you access the Offerings.Â However, you may make a request to opt-out of or limit any processing activities as described herein or through the links available on the Offering.

This section of the Privacy Notice is intended solely for, and is applicable only as to, California residents.

This may include showing you advertisements on other websites.Â The following table identifies the categories of Personal Information that we sold or shared to third parties in the 12 months preceding the last update of this Privacy Notice and, for each category, the category of third parties to whom we sold or shared Personal Information. For more detailed information about this type of sharing please review our Cookie Notice for details about the specific entities that we may share your data with.

Notice of Financial Incentive From time to time, you may have the opportunity to provide personal information in exchange for discounts and price differences.

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will remove you from those companiesâ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through the Schwanâs Offerings or on other third party websites. Even if you opt-out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt-out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out action may not be effective.
