material measurement the m7 monitoring system is the most accurate versatile and cost-effective way to manage road striping and applications now you can know what product you are applying where you are applying it and how much is being used without ever getting out of the truck easy on-the-road monitoring the plc makes calculations analyzes data and sends reports to the computer screen in the cab of the truck so the driver can effectively manage the use of materials while driving down the road reports can be programmed to provide data tailored to your needs the present job or your equipment reports can be printed on a portable printer real-time monitoring inside the truck condensed run screen option m7 systems were designed to better control the efficient use of paint and materials saving time and money when striping paved surfaces these versatile controls let you decide from a wide array of measurements m7 integrated controls incorporate today’s striping equipment with tomorrow’s technology the m7 patented system is the only monitoring system in the united states that measures all material usage based on weight it brings truck data in real time to a plc programmable logic controller so that the driver can maintain proper application rates and adherence to specifications download brochure thermo brochure if you can’t monitor your costs you can’t control them the m7 monitoring system tells you what materials you are using and what you have left in real time it does not simulate the use of material as do competitive products the m7 gives you accurate reliable information to use in managing roadway striping jobs the versatile m7 monitoring system can be mounted on both pressurized and airless systems laptop computer utilizes windows operating system exportability of data to excel spreadsheet floppy or scandisk to analyze at a later time or for ddl reporting purposes guns are active when solenoid is energized striping will continue in the event monitoring system is off or down runs on 12 volt system developed by engineers and contractors with many years of field experience is another quality innovative product from epic solutions improves safety and keeps workers out of harm’s way portable 8 1/2″ x 11″ printer for hard copy option gps option gps capabilities the gps system capabilities allows you to track exactly where you are on the job and on the map the plc computes data and maps it out for you to use manage striping jobs more effectively with this revolutionary technology how it works key benefits weight-based material measurement the m7 patented system is the only system of its kind in the us it records the actual weight of material in your tanks load cells are installed under each tank to record the live weight of the system tanks at all times dual measurement in addition to the load cells that measure weight the m7 provides for the alternative method of counting the number of strokes the pump performs and the amount of material used per stroke it also gathers data on weight and strokes per gun distance traveled line width and lenh per gun ambient temperature surface temperature humidity dew point and product temperature real-time measurement the operator monitors what is happening in real time — right now there is no need to stop to check tanks the driver knows how much material is being used and how much is left in the tanks with very precise measurements this feature alone can get jobs done faster as well as improving your safety records accurate and reliable the m7 uses the best load cells sending the most precise and reliable data to the operator saving time and money because it measures actual material used not estimates or projections the m7′s output is accurate to the fraction of a gallon or pound programmable analysis the programmable logic controller plc receives and analyzes data for easy retrieval on the driver’s laptop the many measurements along with specific calculations and analyses can be tailored to your specific jobs or situations all of these measurements can be used to calculate points of beads per gallon paint line thickness in mils or anything else relevant to your job ultimate operator control the m7 monitoring system is a way to really get any job under control you can set up your own information needs for easy viewing allowing for troubleshooting before small variances from specifications become serious problems you can stick to those specs have data for reports later and modify settings as you go along less time saves money programmable logic controller the programmable logic controller or plc is the brains of the system it receives data computes it calculates what you need to know and reports it these versatile controls let you decide from a wide array of measurement tools and calculations ie ‘programmable’ it can control 3 guns 6 guns or up to 24 guns it works on pressurized or airless striping equipment and runs on 12 volts of electricity the load cells send data to the plc that analyzes data and makes calculations quickly then it sends the findings to an excel file on a laptop computer in the cab of the truck you can even get a portable printer to make hard copies and prepare dsl reports gps capabilities the gps system capabilities allow you to track exactly where you are on the job

brochure the cone handling system series of machines consists of a cone setter and your choice of either the cr 3200 cone retriever for cones up to 28″ tall or the cr 3236 cone retriever for 36″ cones after using the cone retrievers you’ll wonder how you ever picked cones up by hand these machines only require a driver and one person in back to unload the stacked cones from the unit no one hangs off the side of the truck and no one jumps on and off to retrieve tipped cones the cone retrievers can pick up cones in any orientation standing or lying down at up to 15 mph the cr 3200 and cr 3236 are built solid to take the abuse sustained from retrieving cones at high speeds yet can set up in a matter of minutes by one person using the standard electrical hydraulic mounting device and all this while saving lives saving labor through automation easy operation of cr 3200 and cr 3236 cone retrievers let your hands do the walking instead of your feet what used to be labor-intensive and dangerous is now easy and safe to retrieve cones in the past workers needed to either hang off of a truck to grab cones while the truck was moving or to jump off of the moving truck to get tipped cones they often did this within just a few feet of passing traffic instead the cone retrievers only need you to: move the machine into place using the electrical hydraulic unit drive along cones in roadway that are tipped or standing let the machine pick them up have workers unload the stacked cones from machine with specially designed grabber hooks all of this can be accomplished at up to 15 mph depending upon the spacing of cones and the abilities of the workers to keep up with the machine “one of the most difficult things to do is pick up cones that have tipped over you either need to lean way down or get off of the truck that’s not a problem any more with ram” randy george district manager northern district united rentals highway technologies benefits include: easy to operate with hand-held controls requires only a driver and one person in back to unload cones from the ram unit–no one hangs off the truck pick up cones from any position standing or lying down in any orientation and stack them for the operator no one has to jump off of a moving truck to retrieve tipped cones retrieval speed varies by number of cones–up to 15 mph setup takes only minutes and can be done by one person reduce risk of injury and death increase efficiency and productivity lower labor costs while saving lives stacks up to five cones at a time before needing to be removed from machine cr 3200
