editing crispr-cas shows promise in leveraging nonclinical and manufacturing information from one disease indication to another potentially without repeating redundant costly and time-consuming nonclinical studies that’s the driving message in a webinar that featured a pioneer in human genome editing dr fyodor urnov scientific director at the innovative genomics institute igiin this gen webinar from october 12 developed with igi and aldevron dr urnov laid out the challenges facing the clinical genome editing community for expanding the public health impact of crispr-cas urnov pointed out that attaining scalable clinic-grade manufacture of a therapeutic faces several financial logistical and regulatory hurdles costs timelines and regulatory requirements make treating the vast majority of genetic disease intractable in a practical sense as part of the discussion urnov pointed to the unique nature of the non-viral delivery of crispr-cas through complexing with ribonucleoproteins rnps where key aspects of the manufacturing framework could be leveraged to address multiple “rare” disease indications his assessment of the progress in clinical genome editing showed how further gains would be enabled by creative academia-industry partnerships—partnerships developed to build real-world manufacturing innovation in the crispr-cas as a therapeutic platform space aldevron’s tom foti vice president & general manager and tim morris manager of upstream development both of the company’s protein business unit joined urnov after his presentation expressing their support for those creative partnerships sparking further discussion during the q&a sessionurnov stressed that integration of r&d and partnership spaces must begin now to enable progress in the development area and how it all must be supported with a robust yet easily navigated regulatory structure to learn more about dr urnov’s views on crispr cures 2033 along with additional perspective
