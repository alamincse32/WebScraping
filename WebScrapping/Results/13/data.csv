raw materials sourced from this great land precision machine & manufacturing has been building the finest components in the industry since 1978 and throughout our ranks today are hard-working americans consisting of; veterans volunteer coaches youth mentors high-school coaches volunteer firefighters and pastors not only does this team of hard-chargers rise to the occasion each day to provide our customers with superior options when it comes to rotary feeders rotary valves and screw conveyors but to also support their operations by ensuring we deliver the components that they are counting on to keep their industrial manufacturing plants operating and their team of operators on the job located in eugene oregon we strive every day to do the following: -to conduct ourselves professionally and with integrity -to build components that meet the precise requirements of the application -to exceed our customers’ expectations –to do what we say and say what we do traditional cast-iron rotary valve vs pmm’s heavy duty rotary valve performance performance cast-iron manufacturing process does not allow for the tightest possible rotor to housing clearances resulting in faster wear rates increased maintenance and reduced throughput due to greater “blow-by” the proprietary manufacturing process centers around producing the tightest possible clearances which by standard complies with nfpa regulations minimizing “blow-by” and maximizing throughput durability durability cast-iron harness ranges between 250-350 brinell which results in much faster wear rates significantly reduced throughput increased maintenance and more frequent replacements manufactured from a specialty formulated through-hardened abrasion-resistant steel alloy with a hardness rating of 500 brinell/50 rockwell and is surface treated increasing the overall hardness to near 600 brinell/60 rockwell this results in much slower wear rates far more throughput decreased maintenance and a longer-lasting rotary valve operational temp operational temp standard operating temperatures for cast-iron is limited to between 300-500 degrees fahrenheit configurable to operate at temperatures between 1000-1200 degrees fahrenheit maintenance maintenance difficult to maintain due to being constructed of a single casting resulting in total replacement of the valve if wear is identified in a single area lighter-duty bearings cause shaft misalignment and difficult access furthermore material blockages are commonplace minimal maintenance required the modular design allows for quick onsite wear item replacement resulting in very little downtime heavy-duty outboard roller bearings keep the rotor shaft perfectly aligned eliminating binding caused by misalignment minimal air blow-by keeps material blockages to a minimum rebuild versus replace price price comparatively the sales price of a standard cast iron feeder can be significantly less which is due to the inexpensive casting process and the inherent light-duty construction unfortunately the low initial purchase price is quickly surpassed as these units require more frequent replacements due to increased wear rates overall cost roi return on investment: while the initial sales price may come in a bit higher the longer service life reduced maintenance costs and less downtime result in a more favorable cost roi over the entire lifespan of the product this results in the rotary valve offering a much greater value for the money spent when considering the total costs over time why precision precision has been a wonderful supplier of a great valve that has served us well -mineral processing purchaser washinon the precision advantage component rebuild service not all components are created equal in the crowded industrial material handling industry it would be easy to view all rotary feeders rotary valves and screw conveyors through the same lens however the reality is there is a big difference between our components and all the others every component that precision builds is built with serviceability in mind we strive to make preventative maintenance and/or regular service activities quick and easy because the sooner your moving material the sooner your plant is making money furthermore every component we build is built with the expectation that you will be rebuilding it we strive to put an end to the component graveyard that tends to build up behind most industrial plants by building rotary feeders rotary valves and screw conveyors that are rebuildable this means all precision components can be reconditioned rebuilt and reused several times over which is a tremendous cost savings over the life of the product factory refurbishment with a new factory warranty is the only way to go factory refurbishment with a new factory warranty is the only way to go just like that classic muscle car you continue rebuilding because it has many more miles left in it the same exists with all

difference pmm nfpapa2023-09-21t22:01:55+00:00 statement of compliance – nfpa 69 & 85 standardspmm’s rotary valves are engineered to meet the requirements outlined in the relevant sections of the nfpa 69 standard on explosion prevention systems and the nfpa 85 boiler and combustion systems hazards code 2019 version these standards provide important guidelines and regulations for the safe operation of close-clearance rotary valves operating within industrial manufacturing material handling systemsnfpa frequently asked questionswhat is the purpose of the nfpa the nfpa national fire protection association is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting fire safety and prevention the purpose of the nfpa is to develop and publish codes standards guidelines and best practices to reduce the risk of fire-related hazards and improve overall safety in various settings why is nfpa compliance important by integrating precision machine & manufacturing’s nfpa compliant components into a material handling system pmm’s customers can benefit from enhanced safety reduced fire risks and improved overall operational reliability what does “nfpa compliant” really mean when a product or system is referred to as “nfpa compliant” it means that the company making the statement believes that the component system and/or operation meets the specific requirements outlined in the applicable codes standards and guidelines developed by the national fire protection association nfpa these requirements are designed to promote fire safety and prevent fire-related hazards in various settings important note: any certification or other statement of compliance with the requirements set forth by the nfpa shall not be attributable to the nfpa and is solely the responsibility of the certifier or maker of the statement • reference: nfpa 69 page 1 important notices and disclaimers concerning nfpa standards does the nfpa certify products and systems no although the nfpa administers the standards guidelines and/or rules the nfpa does not independently test evaluate and/or verify the accuracy of any information or the soundness of any judgments contained in nfpa standards nor does the nfpa list certify test or inspect products designs or installations for compliance with the nfpa standards in addition the nfpa has no power nor does it undertake to police or enforce compliance with the contents of the nfpa standards nor does the nfpa list certify test or inspect products designs or installations for compliance with the nfpa standards reference: nfpa 69 page 1 important notices and disclaimers concerning nfpa standards if the nfpa doesn’t certify equipment and/or systems how is compliance achieved the responsibility for confirming and self-certifying compliance with nfpa guidelines lies with the manufacturer engineering firm systems designer builder or any other entity involved in the design manufacturing or implementation of components systems or processes these entities are responsible for ensuring that their products or systems adhere to the guidelines and specifications established by the nfpa when a company claims that a specific component or material handling system is “nfpa compliant” it generally means that they have manufactured the product or system according to the guidelines outlined by the applicable nfpa standards it is essential for the end-user to exercise independent judgment and if necessary seek the advice of a competent professional in determining whether the products systems or processes being installed and operated comply with the specified guidelines codes and statutes of the applicable nfpa codes ultimately the responsibility for ensuring nfpa compliance and safe operation rests with the end-user the nfpa as well as precision machine & manufacturing disclaims liability for any personal injury property or other damages of any nature whatsoever whether special indirect consequential or compensatory directly or indirectly resulting from the publication use of or reliance on nfpa standards if a fire or explosion occurs is the nfpa or component manufacturer liable and/or responsible no neither the nfpa or precision machine & manufacturing are liable for any damages resulting from an explosion or fire related accident the nfpa and precision machine & manufacturing specifically disclaims liability or responsibility for any personal injury property or other damages of any nature whatsoever whether special indirect consequential or compensatory directly or indirectly resulting from the publication use of or reliance on nfpa standards the nfpa and precision machine & manufacturing also makes no guaranty or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information published herein ultimately the responsibility rests solely with the end-user and/or operator reference: nfpa 69 page 1 important notices and disclaimers concerning nfpa standards difference between nfpa 69 and nfpa 85 guidelines in the realm of rotary feeder rotary valve and airlock manufacturing as well as their operation within material handling systems the nfpa 69 standard and nfpa 85 code are commonly referenced • nfpa 69 provides specific information related to rotary valve manufacturing • nfpa 85 contains guidance for the operation of rotary valves within material handling systems particularly those used in boiler and combustion systems both nfpa 69 and nfpa 85 play important roles in promoting safety and preventing hazards associated with rotary valves rotary feeders and/or airlocks in material handling systems they provide comprehensive guidelines and requirements that manufacturers engineering firms and end-users can reference to ensure compliance with recognized industry best practices why is there only a few manufacturers providing nfpa compliant rotary valves and airlocks nfpa standards are extremely challenging and although some manufacturers may be able to achieve several of specifications outlined in the relevant nfpa subsection achieving 100% compliancy can be an extremely difficult task which is why there are only a handful of oems who manufacture nfpa compliant rotary valves a few of the more difficult subsections that rotary valve oems struggle to achieve are directly related to the design considerations and criteria as outlined in: nfpa 69 12241 12242 and 12245 and built with sufficient strenh to withstand “explosion pressure” 122431 as well as with no structure deflection or deformation 122433 these are extremely difficult standards to achieve and when combined with subsection 122433 “certified or tested by a knowledgeable test authority” and combined with the relevant subsections outlined in nfpa 85 most oem’s are simply not able to get their products completely across the finish line most companies are quite vague about how their rotary valve and/or airlock complies with the nfpa standards and codes it is for this reason why precision machine & manufacturing took the time to specifically list all of the relevant nfpa standards and subsections see below relating to rotary valves rotary feeders and airlocks and very clearly provides the information relating to how precision machine & manufacturing’s rotary valves meet or exceed each nfpa subsection we believe in transparency which is why we are the first rotary feeder manufacturer to take the time and outline each of the relevant nfpa subsections and how pmm’s rotary valves are compliant nfpa 69 – standard on explosion prevention systems 2019standard 12242 relevant section: chapter 12 deflagration control by passive isolation rotary valve design criteria pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are designed per “close clearance valve” specifications as outlined in nfpa 69 subsection: 12245 standard 122431 the valve body and rotor shall have sufficient strenh to withstand the maximum anticipated explosion pressure pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves have a design pressure of 149 psi standard 122433 the valve pressure resistance shall be verified or tested by a knowledgeable test authority pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves have been tested by an independent authority and tested up to 50 psi with no structure deflection or deformation standard 122434 there shall be at least six vanes on the rotary diametrically opposed pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are equipped with eight vanes which are all diametrically opposed and have at least two rotor touching the housing at all times standard 122435 at least two vanes on each side of the valve housing shall be in a position of minimum clearance at all times pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are constructed to ensure that at least two of the valve’s eight vanes are in contact with each side of the barrel housing at all times standard 122436 the valve shall have metal body and vanes unless it is shown by best data that nonmetallic or composite materials prevent flame passage pmm nfpa compliance: all pmm rotary valves contain a metal body and rotor each is manufactured from a specialty through hardened 500 brinell abrasion-resistant steel alloy which is ion-nitride surface treated to obtain a hardness rating of 62-64 rockwell standard 122437 rotary valve bearings shall be mounted externally pmm nfpa compliance: all pmm rotary valves are equipped with heavy-duty outboard tapered roller bearings standard 122451 close-clearance rotary valves shall be designed with a clearance between the vane and the valve body less than or equal to 02 mm 0008 in pmm nfpa compliance: as a “close-clearance rotary valve” the pmv & pmk rotary valves are sized for minimal airflow thanks to the industry leading 005” minimum rotor to barrel housing clearance -sizing information: all pmm rotary valves are sized according to the operational material and environment temperature of the application where the rotary valve will be placed -depending upon the operational temperature the clearance at startup might be slightly larger/smaller to allow for the precise amount of rotor swelling/shrinking while also achieving the closest rotor to barrel clearance possible standard 122452 the clearance between vane and valve body shall be small enough to prevent the passage of flame between the rotor and the valve housing pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are manufactured per a specialized proprietary process which allows for the tightest possible clearance between the rotor and housing while still allowing the rotor to turn -please note: no rotary valve is 100% air-tight and although pmm’s industry leading rotary valves do posses the tightest possible rotor to housing clearance among all rotary valve manufacturers minimal space is necessary to enable turning of the rotor standard 122453 actual clearances of such rotary valves shall be measured before installation and monitored using a predictive maintenance program such that the design clearance is not exceeded due to wear pmm nfpa compliance: all pmm rotary valves are shipped from the factory with the precise amount of clearance to meet the operational temperature of the environment -please note: it is the responsibility of the end-user/operating company to ensure deployment of a comprehensive preventive maintenance program which occurs at specific intervals preferably every 3-months at a minimum includes measuring and monitoring rotor to housing clearances and is capable of making adjustments and/or replacing worn components when necessary -please note: when the rotary valve is received the actual clearances may be slightly larger/smaller this is to allow for expansion or shrinkage do to the environmental temperatures of the application where the rotary valve will be operating standard 12246 rotary valve application limits: rotary valves shall not be permitted to be used as an isolation device for systems handling hybrid mixtures or gases pmm nfpa compliance: we agree here at pmm we do not endorse the use of pmm rotary valves as an isolation device in these types of applications annex a a12245 testing has shown that rotary valves can be effective in isolating explosion propagation if the following conditions are in place: 1 there are three vanes on each side of the valve that are diametrically opposed 2 a close tolerance is maintained between the vanes and the valve body less than or equal to 008” 3 two vanes per side are always in contact with the housing 4 the vanes or tips are made out of metal and have a thickness of at least 12” pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves meet the specifications at outlined nfpa 85 – boiler and combustion systems hazards code 2019: chapter 9 – pulverized fuel systems please note: although pmm rotary valves are compliant with a variety of nfpa 85 standards the pulverized fuel system standard encompasses the majority if not all the relevant compliance points standard 913 covers pulverized fuel systems designed to reduce fuel to a size such that at least 50% will pass through 200-mesh 74 micron sieve pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are manufactured per nfpa 69 standards which is applicable in various nfpa 85 codes referencing boiler and stoker applications standard 936 where used as a means for deflagration isolation rotary valves material chokes shall be installed and maintained in accordance with nfpa 69 pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves are manufactured per nfpa 69 standards standard 94322 all components of the raw fuel feeder system shall be designed to withstand an internal deflagration without rupture pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves have been tested by an independent test authority up to 50 psi with no structure deflection or deformation standard 943271 all valves in the raw fuel feeder system shall have construction capable of withstanding pressures as defined in 94322 pmm nfpa compliance: pmm rotary valves have a design pressure of 149 psi standard 973321 special dust tight valves shall be installed at each fuel outlet of the pulverized fuel bin the fuel discharge outlet and each fuel outlet of the pulverized fuel distributors pmm rotary valves
