6,director of prosthetics brings cutting-edge technology to sandhills clinic protosthetics protostheticsgalileo central fabrication blog about ï¡¹+1 701-478-2001annie hockert9/12/2023share on: facebook twitter linkedindirector of prosthetics brings cutting-edge technology to sandhills clinicsandhills orthotics and prosthetics in pinehurst nc was established in 2001 with a mission to compassionately and expertly provide orthotics and prosthetics to their patients included in that mission is a promise to utilize the latest cutting-edge technology to ensure the best possible outcomesâas the director of prosthetics at sandhills troy decker bocp takes this goal to heart âour patients look to our referral sources to see that weâre a cutting-edge facility and staying on top of whatâs newest and bestâ said decker and he intends to prove the sandhills facility fits that criteriaâin the past doing all the fabrication by hand took valuable time away from patients and evenings away from his family to keep up with the workload providing 3d printed prosthetics had always been on deckerâs radar as a solution but he didnt dive for it until galileo came alongâdecker with the protosthetics galileo printer and 3d printed socketsâin november 2022 decker implemented 3d printing at sandhills by introducing the galileo program and his team completely embraced the new process with proof of efficiency decker sees galileo as another technical team on his side âtheyâre just a text away a phone call away and are always so receptiveââ âwith the 3d printer on-site decker and his team can rapidly turn ideas into reality and gain control over their work they know whatâs in process and they donât have to wait for shipping services âit has been a pretty seamless transition from what we were using to this program weâve had better communication and better turn-around timesâ he mentionedâ ââit has been a pretty seamless transition from what we were using to this program weâve had better communication and better turn-around timesââwithin 24 hours they can send a scan in print the order overnight and have the patient try it on the next day âweâre very sensitive to amputees and how quickly they get their prostheses to increase their quality of lifeâ decker stated âas far as providing better services to our patients we can provide better turn-around times with 3d printingââsandhills logo printed into a petg socketâsandhillâs prosthetic technician thomas vanaman has also proven instrumental in fully taking advantage of galileo he assisted in researching and integrating the galileo program and he quickly took charge maintaining the machine and starting prints which has taken significantly less time than previous work fully fabricating the check socketsâvanamanâs creativity has also transformed their printer into an advertising tool he strategically placed the 3d printer in the facilitys lobby captivating visitors and proving the practices commitment to innovation âyouâd be amazed how much interest that generates and it shows patients that weâre doing our best to stay up with the latest greatest technologyâ said deckerâadditionally vanaman had the brilliant idea to transform a 3d printed check socket into a lamp wiring rgb colors into the socket to light it up and showcase it to teammates and patients alike âitâs almost been a better marketing tool without even planning on itâ decker exclaimed in awe âeverybody thinks itâs awesomeââcheck socket lamp changing colorsâitâs almost been a better marketing tool without even planning on itââto those considering the leap into galileo 3d printing deckerâs message is clear: embrace it wholeheartedly the benefits from improved communication and turnaround time to enhanced patient care and a touch of innovation are undeniable âitâs a wonderful team of technicians that are ready to serve and answer questionsââhaving printed over 120 galileo orders in 10 months the sandhills team remains headstrong in energizing their work with the program not only has it transformed deckerâs process but it has helped maintain their reputation as a cutting-edge facility âgetting galileo is definitely a step in the right directionâ said decker âi would not look backââabout sandhills orthotics and prostheticssandhills orthotics and prosthetics is a clinic in pinehurst north carolina focused on providing orthotic prosthetic and mastectomy services they are

twitter linkedinnew life with limbs: empowering lives through prosthetics and 3d printingin 2013 james goff cp embarked on a life-changing journey to establish new life with limbs a nonprofit organization with a noble mission: to provide prosthetic limbs to people in developing world countries with limited access to prosthetics goff has been on over 10 trips in 10 years bringing prosthetics to haiti sierra leone and most recently the dominican republicâsierra leone in particular holds a significant place in his heart due to its history of civil war during which many individuals were left amputated the organizations work in these countries has been transformative giving amputees a new lease on life goff mentioned that âto do this job you have to love people and watching them get back to life and be a whole person is the best partâ âwatching them get back to life and be a whole person is the best partâ âgoff and the new life with limbs crew had the opportunity to visit the dominican republic twice in 2022 and again in july of 2023 they have another trip planned for february 2024 âwe put in the hard work here and now so we can have fun and make a difference over thereâ he said of creating the sockets for a good causeâjames goff back and new life with limbs crew member left stand with prosthetic recipient in the dominican republic 2023âover the years new life with limbs has gained support through various fundraising events notably the organization holds an annual sponsorship golf tournament which recently celebrated its 5th year this year the event was a tremendous success with 18 teams of 4 participating and filling the golf courseâover $14000 was raised during the outing enabling them to make a more significant impact the time and effort dedicated to creating the products is volunteer-based so 100% of funds goes to supplying the prosthetics to those in need thus when goff decided to embrace the potential of 3d printing technology it made this yearâs goal more attainableâ âin march of 2023 goff added the protosthetics galileo program as his additive manufacturing partner in 3d printing since then heâs become comfortable with the printing process for his business prosthetic solutions of indiana â3d printing has deleted extra steps and made everything more seamlessâ said goff so when he began considering fabrication options for new life with limbs he turned to galileoâ ââ3d printing has deleted extra steps and made everything more seamlessâprotosthetics readily agreed to print copoly diagnostic sockets for the charity and charge only for the cost of material and shipping new life with limbs supplied around 50 prosthetics during this yearâs trip to the dominican republic 39 of which were printed with galileo and their partners at filament innovations ânot only did gaileo save time and money but it made this yearâs trip possibleâ said goffâcopoly sockets lined up for distribution dominican republic 2023âthe use of 3d printing increased fabrication efficiency allowing the nonprofit to allocate more resources to its core mission goff particularly liked being able to start a print and then focus on other work before starting the next âwhen working on a time crunch itâs important to have peace of mind that everything will get doneâ he said of 3d printing time-savingsâjames goff and new life with limbs have been providing hope mobility and empowerment to hundreds of amputees around the world not only are they helping people physically but they also see their mission as a vehicle to spread the gospel of jesus âgod has blessed us with this awesome opportunityâ he rejoiced âwe will share the love of christ with the worldââ ââgod has blessed us with this awesome opportunityââas they continue their mission new life with limbs will be a beacon of light for those in need proving that technology compassion and a

along with his wife and partner nancy - went to the new york maker faire a convention of creators and inventions 3d printing was just really starting to take off then and miller remembers already wanting to try printing prostheticsâco-owners mark cpo and nancy ceo of miller prosthetics & orthoticsâhowever he was shocked by how many innovators at the faire knocked down the idea hailing it as impossible to print organic shapes still printers emerged for that very purpose and he eagerly tried to utilize several different brands âi was on my 2nd or 3rd desktop 3d printer but i was never able to really do anything with themâ miller stated âgetting the scan to print the right shape has always been the issueââ âbut when nancy suggested the newly-rising galileo program miller didnât hesitate to give it a try soon he found the experience ârefreshingly surprisingâ when it exceeded the teamâs expectations âat first i wasnât sure how accurate everything was going to be but the shapes the process - everything seems to be really spot-onâ the ability to receive text notifications when prints are ready on their in-clinic printer combined with the programâs efficient turnaround time has revolutionized millerâs day-to-day processesâ ââat first i wasnât sure how accurate everything was going to be but the shapes the process - everything seems to be really spot-onâââthereâs no downtime with itâ mentioned miller right now he takes a scan modifies it sends in an order and itâs ready to print in a matter of hours he also recalled a time when he briefly stopped in the print-room to see a print had been completed miller started the next print and left checking on it via a live webcam he was in and out in minutes and had the confidence to leave it on its own so he could prioritize patientsâ âmark miller shows off galileo 3d printed check socket & inner linerâanother notable benefit of using galileo according to miller is the galileo teamâs dedication to constantly improving âiâve been doing cad for 30 years and you get a lot of people who donât do what they say theyâre going to do with regards to product improvements galileo is the oppositeâ in fact miller was able to work with the galileo team to get his own flexible inner print design that was optimized for their team to use in laminationâ ââiâve been doing cad for 30 years and you get a lot of people who donât do what they say theyâre going to do with regards to product improvements galileo is the oppositeââwith a passion for innovation deeply rooted in their practice the miller p&o team remains committed to embracing the future in reference to whether he would recommend galileo âget itâ miller said âexcept my competitors -
