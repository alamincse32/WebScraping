Very easy to assemble. Very sturdy and well built. Going to buy some more now for family members! Superb.”~ Joseph O. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Been using my Trimyxs attachment for a few weeks now with ZERO regrets! Saves so much time as I can now edge and trim without changing from my mower to other power tools PS- If you have a fence in your backyard, this is a game changer." ~ Jeff.K ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “This thing works great. I was originally excited to just get the weed eating capabilities to hit all of the areas and landscaping around my home while I mow, but then realized that the edging feature is just as great. Now my sidewalk and driveway edges stay sharp and it's a breeze to keep this in a straight line so I don't gouge into the lawn. I wish I had this years ago!” ~ Alec B. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Great product and great after market support. The Trimyxs makes weed whacking and edging easier. Less strain on the back. Customer support is fantastic.”~ Andrew A . ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “The order and shipping experience was very smooth with fast delivery.”~ Donald H. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Works great, saves a huge amount of time and much easier on my back to not have to carry an actual trimmer.”~ Patrick W. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Had some fitment issues with the hardware I received with my mower but the owner gave me his personal contact information and worked through the issue and quickly sent some new hardware to make the trimmer fit my mower.
