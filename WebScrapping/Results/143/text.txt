OUR STORY- Family Owned and Operated Since 1983 T.R.S. Industries was started in 1983 in the garage of Roger and Claudia Cossette. In 1989 the company expanded to the Fargo Industrial Park and built a building large enough to drive a Semi Truck or trailer into the shop for repairs and installations. In 2005 T.R.S. Industries expanded to add the Fabrics Division, which was located directly behind the existing building and used for new tarp production and custom covers. In 2013, T.R.S. Industries added 36,000 square feet onto their new building, located at 1230 40th St. N, which increased manufacturing space to 69,000 square feet.We are always looking for motivated, hard working team members to join our crew!
