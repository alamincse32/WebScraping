and a great professional look to your 3d printer products: schark parts™ is an exclusive line of all-aluminum 3d printer modifications why upgrade “stock plastic parts are prone to warping flexing or even melting…” 3d printer owners desire precision out the their machines they look to mods and upgrades to get the best results the stock plastic parts on many 3d printers are prone to warping flexing

enough to effect the operating parts of your printer this is very true if you are printing with materials that require temps higher than what your 3d printer was designed for avoid melted abs parts
