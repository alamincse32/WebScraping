""Earl"" Branick started a tire and vulcanizing shop in Dickinson, North Dakota. Finding it hard to do vulcanizing from a book and old molds, Earl decided to put things on hold. He set off to work for Firestone and B.F. Goodrich where he built new tires and repaired old ones. In 1917, after serving in the Army, Earl established the Branick Vulcanizing Company in Fargo, North Dakota.Earl was an entrepreneur and prolific innovator. He invented a tire spreader that became the foundation for over 35 spreaders that Branick manufactured and sold worldwide. Earl continued to introduce other products, including air jacks, tire changers, tire inflation cages, and other specialty tools. Over the years, Branick has been issued over 100 patents for various designs.Today, Branick has evolved to become an industry leader in tire service equipment, tire repair equipment, tire inflation systems, and nitrogen tire inflation systems. With over 750,000 customers worldwide, we proudly remain focused on the tradition of quality instilled by Mr. Branick, while a team of research and development (R&D) engineers continue his legacy of innovation.
