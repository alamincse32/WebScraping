its first reporting year 2020 bayer bitterfeld gmbh undertook to increase the proportion of women at the first management level below executive management to 20 percent by mid-2022 and at the second management level to 30 percent by then bayer bitterfeld gmbh achieved both targets with 231 and 301 percent respectively in 2017 bayer gastronomie gmbh had formulated a target quota of 20 percent for the first management level below the executive board and aimed to increase the proportion of women from 15 to 25 percent for the second management level by mid-2022 the company achieved or exceeded both targets with women accounting for 50 and 318 percent respectively as of june 30 2022 in 2017 bayer vital gmbh set a target for the proportion of women at the first management level below executive management of 20 percent by mid-2022 this target was significantly exceeded with 6667 percent women as of june 30 2022 at the second management level bayer vital aimed to increase the proportion of women to 22 percent by mid-2022 this target was also met and exceeded with women accounting for 2857 percent of the workforce as of the reporting date new targets up to june 30 2027 bayer has reviewed the targets for the proportion of women in senior management positions in accordance with the provisions of the füpog and formulated new targets for the period up to june 30 2027 specifically the responsible corporate bodies of the respective companies have resolved the following targets bayer ag other reportable group companies bayer ag women on the supervisory board and board of management there are statutory requirements for the proportion of women and men on the supervisory board and board of management of bayer ag and now also for the board of management in accordance with the second leadership positions act füpog ii for the supervisory board the law continues to stipulate a minimum proportion of women and men of at least 30 percent each for the board of management of bayer ag which consists of more than three persons the law stipulates that it must include at least one woman and at least one man apart from this no self-imposed targets are required women at the first and second management levels below the board of management as part of the new targets for the period up to june 30 2027 bayer ag has reviewed the demarcation of the first and second management levels and defines them more narrowly for the new targets than in the past this ensures that the targets relate to a smaller number of particularly high-ranking positions that are especially relevant for the development of female leadership talent with regard to top positions including positions on the board of management the targets and underlying management levels are thus in line with those of our internal corporate strategy for greater inclusion and diversity i&d for the proportion of women at the first management level below the board of management bayer ag is aiming for a target of 35 percent by june 30 2027 formal target under füpog ii: 36 16/19 percent1 this management level is identical to the group executive circle gec of the 75 highest-ranking executives in the group worldwide at the second management level below the board of management the proportion of women at bayer ag is also to be 35 percent by mid-2027 formal target under füpog ii: 35 35/199 percent these are the members of the bayer groups group leadership circle glc which currently comprises around 540 managers worldwide 1 here as well as in the following the target size is stated first followed in parentheses by the percentage to be stated in accordance with füpog ii which results in a whole head count based on the current size of the group other reportable group companies women on the supervisory board the other reportable group companies have formulated the following targets for the proportion of women on the supervisory board by mid-2027 at bayer bitterfeld gmbh the existing proportion of women on the supervisory board of 3333 percent formal target under füpog ii: 33 1/3 percent is to be maintained through mid-2027 in june 2022 the proportion of women on the supervisory board of bayer gastronomie gmbh was an unplanned 100 percent by 2027 the gender ratio on the board is to be rebalanced to 6667 percent formal target pursuant to füpog ii: 66 2/3 percent bayer vital gmbh intends to keep the proportion of women on its supervisory board stable at 3333 percent in mid-june 2022 over the next five years formal target pursuant to füpog ii at: 33 1/3 percent gp grenzach produktions gmbh is aiming for a 66 2/3 percent share of women on its newly formed supervisory board by mid-2027 formal target in accordance with füpog ii: 66 2/3 percent women on the board of management the target for the proportion of women on the management boards of bayer bitterfeld gmbh bayer gastronomie gmbh and bayer vital gmbh is the same as the proportion of women in mid-june 2022 namely 0 persons and 0 percent respectively the target of zero is set in these cases because the management continues to consist exclusively of a man whose appointment is for an indefinite period there are currently no plans to increase the size of the executive board setting the target at zero is therefore also in line with the act to supplement and amend the regulations for the equal participation of women and men in management positions in the private and public sectors second management positions act füpog ii which aims to increase the proportion of women in existing management positions but does not want to increase the proportion of women through additional management positions in addition it should not be necessary to set a target whose non-fulfillment is already foreseeable at the time the resolution is passed women at the first and second management levels below the board of management the first and second management levels are defined in the smaller group companies subject to reporting requirements in accordance with their respective specific characteristics and thus differently from bayer ag bayer bitterfeld gmbh had a proportion of women at the first management level below the board of management of 231 percent in mid-2022 this is to rise to 30 percent by june 30 2027 formal target under füpog ii: 30 10/13 percent at the second management level bayer bitterfeld gmbh aims to increase the proportion of women from around 30 percent to 40 percent by mid-2027 formal target under füpog ii: 40 5/13 percent bayer gastronomie gmbh intends to maintain the gender parity already achieved in mid-2022 at the first management level below management by mid-2027 formal target pursuant to füpog ii: 500 percent at the second management level the proportion of women is also to be maintained at the current level of 30 percent by july 30 2027 formal target under füpog ii also: 300 percent bayer vital gmbh aims to achieve gender parity ie a 50 percent share of women at the first management level below the board of management by mid-2027 formal target under füpog ii also: 5000 percent for the second management level below the board of management the target for the proportion of women by then is 40 percent formal target under füpog ii also: 4000 percent gp grenzach produktions gmbh intends to increase the proportion of women at the first and second management levels below management to 50 percent in each case by mid-2027 ie it aims to achieve gender parity in the companys management additional voluntary ambitions for gender parity in management worldwide beyond these legally required targets for the proportion of women in management positions at the german companies bayer has for years been voluntarily committed to achieving greater gender balance in management at group level in february 2021 we published a comprehensive strategy for greater inclusion and diversity throughout the group each of which also includes specific targets according to this strategy the average gender ratio at all combined management levels in the group including lower and middle management is to be 50/50 by 2025 in the global executive committee top 75 and the group leadership circle top 540 the proportion of women is to be at least 33 percent by then bayer aims to achieve full gender parity at all management levels by 2030 we will pursue this strategy for gender parity in management with commitment in the coming years and report transparently on its current status in doing so we will also continue to be guided by our definition

specific processing activities compliance hotline calendar contact us history & background the bayer cross – logo and landmark bayer’s trademark is seen on products at sports events and in tv commercials and glows at the head quarter’s site in leverkusen the bayer cross symbol of the bayer group which was founded more than 150 years ago is one of the world’s best-known trademarks it was registered in the patent register more than 110 years ago on january 6 1904 initially the cross was registered for use for medications for people and animals disinfectants preservatives tar dyes and chemical preparations for dyeing and photographic purposes since 1914 it has also been used for the company’s crop protection products the predecessor of today’s bayer cross was linked to the company’s historyit is not clear exactly who designed the bayer cross as the companys archives contain two different versions of its origins one ascribes the initial idea to hans schneider who worked in the scientific department in elberfeld germany an eye-witness wrote: it was in 1900 while i was discussing a few things with him hans schneider he wrote the word bayer in capital letters on a piece of paper - once horizontally and then again vertically the result was the bayer cross he tore the page from his notepad excused himself and took his sketch to the management where it was greatly admired the second version names dr schweizer as the inventor of the bayer cross schweizer worked in bayers new york office in the 1890s his job was to interest american physicians in the products from germany apparently the companys long name at that time - farbenfabriken vormals friedr bayer & co elberfeld - made communication difficult so schweizer developed an eye-catching company stamp in the form of the cross that is now so well-known the cross also received approbation from the companys headquarters in elberfeld out with the lion – in with the cross every year in spring and fall the lights of the bayer cross are switched off for some hours so migratory birds do not get disoriented the lion with the grid left the picture on the right shows the lion with the caduceus and the globewhoever came up with the original idea the new logo made its mark around the world and eventually replaced bayers original lion trademark this predecessor to the bayer cross was linked to the companys history when the company was granted with its first german patent for crocein acid in 1863 it needed a trademark as a seal of quality and a unique identifier it chose a heraldic emblem based on the coat of arms of elberfeld where it was headquartered at the time: a two-tailed lion holding the grid on which the towns patron saint lawrence was martyred a few years later a helmet and further embellishments were added it was modified again in 1895 becoming a winged lion holding a caduceus and standing over a globe today there are more than 47 large illuminated advertising sites featuring the bayer logo in the first years after its registration the new bayer cross trademark was used alongside the lion and the companys name in europe whereas bayers offices outside germany used only the new emblem on all documents and packaging over time it also replaced the bayer lion in europe a milestone in the popularity of the logo and a smart marketing idea was the decision to stamp the new logo on tablets especially aspirin™ from 1910 this protected the companys pharmaceutical products from counterfeiting and soon became familiar to consumers as a symbol of premium quality a new painting bayers trademark has been updated several times since it was first in 1904 in 2002 the cross got a new coat it was the first colored version of the bayer cross in the company colors of blue and green and should symbolize bayers modernity and freshness after a modification in 2010 the bayer cross was slightly redesigned in 2017 with this graphic evolution it is now ready for the digital age as there is not a huge change the different lies in the detail the color gradients in the circle are gone and the colors were modified this makes it easier to use the logo in the digital media and gives the trademark a more modern and up-to-date look the bayer cross becomes a landmark 1933 the illuminated bayer- cross became a landmark at the leverkusen sitein 1929 the trademark was modified and updated for the first time when the previously slightly italicized letters were straightened marketing ideas reached a new peak on february 20 1933 with a technical sensation the bayer cross was displayed as a flashing illumination between two smokestacks at the leverkusen site 72 meters in diameter with 2200 electric light bulbs an illuminated circle appeared first then the letters lit up the bayer cross in leverkusen has been redesigned and modernized several times since then it is now 51 meters in diameter has letters 7 meters high and is illuminated by 1710 bulbs- making it the biggest trademark in the world in 2009 the original bulbs were replaced by innovative energy-saving light-emitting diodes more about the history of the bayer cross in leverkusen 1933: the first bayer cross the first bayer cross became operational between to smokestacks at the leverkusen site illuminated by 2200 light bulbs with a diameter of 72 meters the bergische post newspaper declared it as the “world’s largest illuminated advertisement” 1958: the second bayer cross on september 2 1958 the new bayer cross was inaugurated in a different place as the old one had been dismantled after the war and production facilities constructed in its place thus a completely new structure was erected a few hundred meters away with a diameter of 51 meters it is not as large as its predecessor 2009: the bayer cross seen in a new light at the end of 2009 new lamps light up the bayer cross: the 1710 conventional 40-watt light bulbs are taken out of service and replaced by innovative light-emitting diodes leds this generates energy savings of more than 80 percent to accompany numerous other initiatives under the bayer climate program the new light-emitting diodes are filled with white oil and are weather-resistant and pollutant-free 2016: modernization of led lamps the 1710 led lamps in the 120-meter-high wire-supported structure have been replaced with more efficient state-of-the-art lamps this change reduced the energy consumption by a further 20 percent it has also made the cross brighter again because compared with the previous leds both shade and brilliance correspond to those of the conventional light bulbs used before the bayer cross worldwide the bayer cross — lost in the war the bayer cross worldwide the bayer cross - and by extension the company as well - is present not just in germany but everywhere in the world for example as long ago as 1934 bayer installed a large illuminated cross over the entrance to the suez canal the cross had a diameter of 20 meters although this advertising sign is no longer present in port said the idea of anchoring the bayer cross in peoples consciousness has survived the test of time today there are more than 47 large illuminated advertising sites featuring the bayer logo including stationary facilities such as sculptures as well as revolving bayer crosses and large-dimension lettering on the outer facades of buildings the bayer cross — lost in the war the treaty of versailles which was signed in 1919 by germany and the allied powers to end world war i brought an abrupt end to the successful companys expansion plans bayers foreign assets were seized along with its patent and trademark rights which included both the bayer cross and aspirin™ an extremely important product at the time the alien property custodian sold the patents of the german chemical industry for only us$ 250000 - a heavy blow for the farbenfabriken this meant that in the united states the bayer name no longer belonged to bayer but to sterling drug it wasnt until 1994 that bayer regained the right to use its name and corporate logo in the united states by acquiring the north american non-prescription drug business of sterling winthrop after more than 74 years however the price had risen dramatically: bayer paid $1 billion for the right to use a uniform corporate logo throughout the world back videos bayer – how it

strategically evolve sustainability topics in procurement in the coming years increasing importance will be placed on environmental and human rights requirements throughout the supply chain and on the supplier inclusion & diversity program improving sustainability practices in the supply chain already in 2020 we stipulated that all strategically important suppliers must present an ecovadis assessment of at least 45 of 100 points “green” assessment or a comparable audit result all potential new suppliers with a procurement spend of more than €250000 will be additionally examined in advance with regard to sustainability aspects we have also implemented plans to monitor the progress of the various sustainability focus areas using indicators and to define appropriate targets more information on this see here climate protection in the supply chain climate protection is a key element of bayer’s strategy and is supported by our supplier code of conduct in 2020 we joined the science-based targets initiative and have set ourselves targets to significantly reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions – those from our own operations scope 1 and 2 as well as those that we inherit via our supply chain scope 3 as part of our science-based targets commitment we will reduce absolute scope 3 ghg emissions from purchased goods and services capital goods fuel and energy related activities upstream transportation and distribution and business travel 123% by 2029 from a 2019 base year through cdp supply chain we ask our strategically important suppliers and those who account for a significantly high proportion of our scope 3 emissions to disclose their climate protection program with bayer we aim to learn more about their greenhouse gas emissions and our share of their emissions attributable to the goods and services sourced by us we also look at their reduction targets and use of renewable electricity furthermore we aim to identify potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions among our suppliers and incorporate this potential into our supplier development efforts in 2022 we started using ecotransit world – like our biggest transport and logistics partners and various industrial companies this software is used for automatic calculation of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions bayer also became a member of the ecotransit world initiative who is geared toward continuously evolving and harmonizing the methods for determining emissions in the transport sector worldwide sustainable palm oil and sustainable soy supply chains: bayer’s net-zero deforestation as well as the human rights commitment along the value chain includes the ambition to source sustainable palm kernel oil and soy derivatives bayer believes in sustainable value chains with the focus on sustainable production transparency traceability and certification our activities are aligned with the elements of the accountability framework we collaborate with our partners and suppliers to further decrease our environmental footprint and set social and ethical standards to ensure the conservation of renewable natural resources as well as the reduction of co2 suppliers shall promote the application of broadly recognized sustainability standards and certifications that have been developed by multiple stakeholders in 2022 we have been disclosing our palm and soy oil activities in the cdp forest questionnaire and received a b rating additionally we have been answering the wwf palm oil scorecard sustainable palm oil in terms of sustainable palm oil we support the certified sustainable production of these raw materials as a purchaser of plant oil derivatives which is especially important in southeast asia but also other regions we are member of the “roundtable on sustainable palm oil” rspo and since 2017 we are buying rspo credits according to the quantities we use in addition we at bayer have decided to move from the rsop credit system towards the rspo supply chain certification the rspo mass balance certification we understand the complexity of our value chains therefore we drafted a trajectory for change targeting to achieve 50% mass balance certification in 2022 in 2023 60% in 2024 70% in 2025 80% in 2026 90% and in 2027 almost 100% certified sustainable palm kernel oil we invite all stakeholders to follow and support in this process sustainable soy in terms of sustainable soy we support the certified sustainable production of these raw materials as a purchaser of plant oil derivatives which is especially important in south america but also other regions we are member of the “round table on responsible soy” rtrs and buy rtrs credits according to the quantities we use the purchase of these credits rewards farmer who grow soy in a legal and ecologically socially and economically sustainable way and who demonstrate this as part of an audited certification process crop science also cooperates with the rtrs to provide mutual support in the certification of brazilian soybean producers according to the high ecological social and economic criteria of the rtrs further information about our crop science food chain partnerships certification and projects with the rtrs can be found here other plant-based materials in terms of other plant-based materials at our pharmaceuticals division hormones are synthesized based on sterols that result during the production of plant oils from soybeans for example as well as during wood processing we also purchase steroids that are manufactured from diosgenin or its intermediate stages this substance is usually obtained from yam grown in countries such as china our consumer health division uses extracts of plants to manufacture plant-based pharmaceuticals we take great care in the cultivation and extraction of raw materials which are performed according to local or international standards eg the gacp good agricultural and collection practice guidelines promoting human rights in the supply chain we unequivocally promote the realization of human rights we firmly believe that respect for people is essential to achieving lasting business excellence the main areas we address are: employees and working conditions harassment and discrimination freedom of association and collective bargaining child labor and health and safety for further information on bayer’s management approach regarding human rights please visit human rights website in 2022 we concentrated on providing training to our procurement employees and our suppliers in respecting human rights in the supply chain and on enhancing procurement processes in order to comply with the requirements of the german supply chain due diligence act scdda in the agriculture industry seed producers are subject to particular risks especially with regard to respecting human rights we performed a deep dive of human rights risks along our seeds supply chain and started to enhance our measures to prevent and mitigate such risks in 2023 we plan to continue improving our procurement processes and take additional measures aiming to respect human rights in our supply chain meeting due diligence obligations related to conflict materials as the procurement of minerals originating from unstable regions of the world can contribute to the financing of conflicts and the violation of human rights we work to ensure that so-called conflict materials are procured responsibly as such additional verification processes were established for the fulfillment of further international regulations such as those requesting companies to disclose the origin of certain raw materials this concerns for example so-called conflict minerals from regions such as the democratic republic of the congo or neighboring countries we use the conflict minerals reporting template to survey our relevant suppliers in order to identify the use sources and origins of certain minerals in our supply chain from regular exchanges of information with other companies we derive measures for timely initiation of process improvements thereby we support our customers in fulfilling the due diligence requirements regarding the origin of certain raw materials in their supply chain suppliers who do not meet these requirements are immediately notified that these standards must be complied with and suitable measures initiated explicit expectations of our suppliers are spelled out in our supplier code of conduct suppliers shall ensure that products supplied to bayer do not contain metals whose raw materials originate from conflict regions that directly or indirectly help to finance or support armed groups and cause or foster human rights abuses diversity in our supply base bayer is committed to

can be provided upon request the transfer of personal data collected in the eu may also be based on different legal bases as defined in art 49 gdpr eg in case this is required for important reasons of

to 31% of all deaths worldwide cardiac imaging is an important tool for ensuring prompt accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment share: facebook twitter email linkedin coronary artery disease cad is the most common type of heart disease and is caused by a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart early diagnosis and treatment are critical as patients with cad are at increased risk of potentially fatal complications such as heart attack and stroke every successful treatment starts with the right diagnosis cardiac imaging – a subspecialty of diagnostic radiology – uses innovative procedures to help cardiologists and radiologists effectively diagnose heart disease such as cad prompt and accurate diagnosis allows doctors to make informed decisions and improves the quality of care for patients by enabling the care team to define an optimal therapy plan moreover cardiac imaging can be used to monitor disease progression or a patient’s response to treatment and to detect other illnesses there are several cardiac medical imaging modalities in addition to x-rays and ultrasounds cardiac radiologists use advanced imaging techniques such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance cmr scans or coronary computed tomography angiography ccta to provide clear direction from diagnosis to care cardiac mri cmr sometimes known as cardiac mri magnetic resonance imaging is a medical imaging technology designed to assess the function and structure of the cardiovascular system in a non-invasive manner the radiation-free procedure is performed in a scanner with a high magnetic field and radio waves cmr generates extremely high-resolution anatomical images of the heart chambers and also provides moving images to evaluate cardiac function in most cases the procedure involves injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent during the scan to highlight the blood vessels and perfused areas on the images this can help provide information about tissue blood supply inflammation and scarring advice for patients everyone’s body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine will work best for you please consult your physician coronary computed tomography angiography and cath lab computed tomography ct angiography images blood vessels using iodinated contrast agents injected into the venous bloodstream ccta uses ct technology to take images of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the muscle of a beating heart and to determine whether they are narrowed or blocked new technologies also allow ccta to predict the negative effects of coronary artery stenoses on the heart muscle ct fractional flow reserve ctffr is one of these leading technologies and allows the radiologist to assess the significance of a stenosis cardiologists also use contrast agents in x-ray angiography for the visualization of coronary stenosis in the catheterization laboratory commonly referred to as a cath lab this is an examination room in a hospital or clinic with diagnostic imaging equipment to visualize the arteries of the heart as well as its chambers and treat any stenosis or abnormality found the arteries are visualized with iodinated x-ray contrast media the importance of ensuring patients are informed patients often experience a wide range of emotions prior to and during a cardiac imaging process informing patients about the benefits and risks of diagnostic procedures is key to empowering them to make a conscious therapy decision with their care team therefore cultivating better and more widespread understanding of how medical imaging is informing and benefitting clinical decisions throughout the continuum of care is crucial in paving the way for improved outcomes for patients bayer’s

explaining chronic heart failure “not to be confused with a heart attack where the heart’s blood supply is suddenly stopped heart failure is a gradual decrease in the heart’s ability to pump enough blood around the body” risk factors associated with heart failure common symptoms of heart failure as less blood is circulating around the body due to heart failure a range of symptoms can be experienced:3 chronic coughing wheezing or shortness of breath dizziness swelling in the legs and ankles fluid retention reduced ability to exercise a heart failure diagnosis can be daunting and the right support is needed when it comes to navigating the road ahead as doctors it is important that we help those living with heart failure to understand how they can best manage their condition and closely monitor symptoms for signs of progression professor carolyn lam senior consultant at the national heart centre singapore & professor of the duke-nus cardiovascular academic clinical program ejection fraction: the difference between hfref and hfpef “the action of a healthy heart is like being able to fill the tank with water and empty most of this tank with a single pull of the lever in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction the tank can fill but the pump is weak” living with worsening heart failure fact a change in symptoms is a warning signal from the body it is important to take action as soon as possible what is worsening heart failure for many people living with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction symptoms can continue to worsen despite receiving guideline-recommended therapies4 for example symptoms can progress to a point where breathing can become very difficult2 such a change may result in needing to go to hospital or a modification to your outpatient treatment regimen – this is referred to as decompensation event also known as a ‘worsening heart failure event’5 recognizing a worsening event in heart failure when living with chronic heart failure it is important to keep a close watch for any changes in symptoms particularly those highlighted below as soon as a change is noticed or if there are any concerns about symptoms a doctor should be contacted1 a change in symptoms is a warning signal from the body and the sooner action is taken the better1 managing worsening heart failure there is a lot that can be done to manage worsening heart failure along with the many treatment options available today there are some lifestyle changes that can be made to better manage the condition and its symptoms7 diet: doctors may recommend reducing the amount of salt alcohol and fat in someone’s diet as well as reducing weight if necessary7 exercise: gentle physical activity can help relieve symptoms and increase wellbeing a doctor can suggest ways to develop a healthy exercise routine7 smoking: smoking can worsen existing damage to the heart muscle making it even more difficult for the heart to transport blood around the body it’s never too late to benefit from stopping smoking7 friends & family: living with heart failure can be worrying but there are things that can help you relax and feel in control of your condition friends and family are an important source of support2 they can help you come to terms with your heart failure and social connections can be a great way to reduce stress and anxiety2 doctor conversations: when living with heart failure open discussion with your doctor is key as well as sharing how symptoms are progressing it’s important to let them know how you are coping emotionally to help them provide you with the additional information and support you may need the heart failure forum is a dedicated online community providing regular tips on managing the condition as well as updates on the latest treatment developments supporting someone with heart failure if you care for someone who has been diagnosed with heart failure it’s important to familiarize yourself with the condition and what to look out for the following advice may help: 7 listen to how they are feeling is an important source of support for them as they may feel uncertain or afraid you can help them come to terms with their heart failure join in with any recommended lifestyle changes – it can be easier for people to make changes together help them to follow the guidance from their doctor so they get the most out of their treatment remind them to take their medicine support them when visiting their doctor; you can help remind them of all the questions they may want to ask as well as any advice they were given by their doctor if the person has been in hospital help to schedule regular follow-up visits after they come home be familiar with their management plan and help ensure their heart failure does not progress further watch out for worsening events and encourage them to speak to their doctor as soon as you notice a difference encourage them to keep all their appointments – patients

clotting factors is missing or deficient that affects your blood’s ability to clot normally share: facebook twitter email linkedin the most common type of hemophilia is hemophilia a it is caused by a missing protein called factor viii this is a protein in the coagulation cascade – a series of reactions that occur in your blood and signal when it should clot what is hemophilia hemophilia is the name given to a rare bleeding disorder that prevents your blood from clotting normally when you have hemophilia mild cuts and grazes will bleed for longer than usual before they clot more seriously if you have hemophilia you are at a greater risk of internal bleeding joints such as your knees ankles and elbows can be at risk of internal bleeding and so can your muscles tissues and internal organs if internal bleeding occurs in an organ especially the brain it can be life-threatening advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician what causes hemophilia hemophilia is usually inherited it occurs because one of the clotting proteins needed to form blood clots in the body is missing or reduced the two main types of hemophilia are a and b if you have hemophilia a youre missing or have low levels of clotting factor viii 8 about 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type a if you have hemophilia b youre missing or have low levels of clotting factor ix 9 rarely hemophilia can be acquired acquired means you arent born with the disorder but you develop it during your lifetime this can happen if your body forms antibodies proteins that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream the antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working there are a number of different types of hemophilia hemophilia a also known as factor viii deficiency or classic hemophilia is the most common if you have hemophilia a you are missing factor viii which is a key protein in the coagulation cascade a series of reactions that tell your blood when to clot about 80 in 100 people with hemophilia have type a in other rarer types of hemophilia such as hemophilia b hemophilia c and von willebrand disease different clotting factors are missing treating hemophilia although there is no cure for hemophilia a treatment called substitution therapy has existed for several decades in substitution therapy the missing coagulation factor protein is injected into blood stream the injection is made by extracting the missing factor protein from either the plasma of donated blood or genetically modified cell cultures using genetically modified cell cultures first became possible after the factor viii gene was discovered in 1984 we were one of the first suppliers of a factor viii product made from genetically modified cell cultures it is considered to be safer than donor blood-derived injections because it cuts out any risk of infection when plasma donors are used as a source for substitution therapy there is a potential risk of blood-borne viruses being spread despite the virus-inactivation measures that have been introduced substitution therapy has been shown to help to protect you from joint bleeds if you have hemophilia however because the injected clotting factor protein is broken down in the body over time it has to be injected several times a week ongoing research bayer has numerous compounds in various stages of development for hemophilia a and other blood and bleeding disorders together these compounds show our commitment to research and development for these conditions if you have hemophilia or a similar bleeding disorder talk to your doctor to find out the best treatment option for you about hemophilia hemophilia is a type of blood disorder that means that your blood does not clot normally it is usually inherited the most common type of hemophilia is hemophilia a it is caused by a missing protein called factor viii this is a protein in the coagulation cascade – a series of reactions that occur in your blood and signal when it should clot hemophilia a also called factor viii fviii deficiency or classic hemophilia is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor viii a clotting protein although it is passed down from parents to children about 1/3 of cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation a change in a gene if you have hemophilia cuts and grazes take longer to clot you are also at higher risk of internal bleeding in joints such as ankles knees and elbows and in internal organs internal bleeding is more serious and if it occurs in an organ such as the brain it can be life-threatening although there is no cure for hemophilia you can be treated with substitution therapy where you inject the missing protein the missing protein can be extracted from blood from donors it can also be grown through genetically modified cell cultures which cuts out any risk of contamination we were one of the first

gist can occur anywhere along the gi tract but is most often found in the stomach 40-70 percent of cases or the small intestine 20-40 percent of cases1 share: facebook twitter email linkedin in europe there are an estimated 10-20 gist cases per million2 and in the us there are approximately 4000-6000 cases diagnosed each year3 gist represents a life-threatening malignancy if the disease has spread to other parts of the body metastasized or is unable to be surgically removed with curative intent the discovery of oncogenic kit kinase mutations in gists and the introduction of kinase inhibitor therapies have led to a rapid evolution in the understanding of these tumors it is now established that over 80% of gists harbor a kit gene mutation that these mutations lead to the continued activation of the kinase and that mutant kit is a clinically important therapeutic target in gist4 unless they are located in certain regions of the digestive system gist may not cause any noticeable symptoms until they reach a certain size as a result gist is often not diagnosed until later stages of disease at which point 15-25% of people diagnosed will have developed metastatic disease5 gist is often diagnosed when blood is detected in the stool or vomit should the tumor grow large enough it can block the passage of food to the stomach or intestine resulting in severe abdominal pain and vomiting over time the continued blood loss will lead to anemia or low red blood cell count causing patients to feel tired and weak advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician treating gist the treatment of gist depends on a number of factors including the patients’ general health and the size and position of the tumor surgery is the main treatment option for gist that has not spread or has only spread into nearby tissue tumors that are larger or located in places where the cancer may be harder to remove without causing potential health problems later on are often prescribed targeted therapies these are known as growth inhibitors and work by blocking growth signals preventing the gist cells from multiplying chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not effective for this type of cancer and are therefore rarely used three growth inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of gist if the tumor cannot be surgically removed and/or has already spread with the entrance of ewer precision oncology treatments some of the gist cases can now also be treated based on their specific genomic alteration bayer treatments for gist bayer has a targeted treatment which is approved in many countries around the world including the us japan and countries of the european

cancer among women globally and – according to the who – impacts 21 million patients each year early detection is crucial to improve the course of the disease share: facebook twitter email linkedin the outlook for patients diagnosed with breast cancer has been gradually improving with significant progress made in recent decades nonetheless despite medical advances breast cancer causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women in 2018 it is estimated that 627000 women died from breast cancer – that is approximately 15 percent of all cancer deaths among women diagnosing the disease early and getting state-of-the-art treatment are the most important strategies to save the lives of patients more than 90 percent of women diagnosed at the earliest stage survive the disease for at least five years compared to around 15 percent for women diagnosed at the most advanced stage of the disease according to cancer research uk prevention and detection risk increases with age with most breast cancers being found in women aged 55 and older about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary meaning they result directly from gene changes mutations passed on from a parent another risk factor is breast density dense breasts have relatively high amounts of glandular tissue and fibrous connective tissue and relatively low amounts of fatty breast tissue nearly half of all women aged 40 and older who get mammograms are found to have dense breasts breast density is often inherited but other factors can influence it and it impacts both breast cancer risk and the accuracy of a breast cancer screening test women with dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with fatty breasts the risk rises with increasing density also mammograms can be harder to read in women with dense breasts which means cancer is more likely to be missed or detected only later at an advanced stage therefore breast density is an important risk factor for hcps to consider when deciding whether a patient should have additional screening examinations advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician diagnosis and breast cancer screening options the most common symptom of breast cancer is a new lump or mass but other symptoms are also possible any change in breast tissue should be checked by a health care provider however many women with breast cancer have no symptoms this is why regular breast cancer screening is so important especially for women at high risk different tests can be used to look for and diagnose breast cancer if a doctor detects an area of concern on a screening test a mammogram or if there are symptoms that could indicate breast cancer more tests will be needed to get an accurate diagnosis bayer’s diagnostic options for breast cancer every treatment starts with the right diagnosis contrast-enhanced x-ray mammography and breast mri magnetic resonance imaging may reveal additional breast cancers which are missed by standard mammography and other options especially in women with high breast density

death globally liver cancer accounts for approximately 830000 deaths worldwide each year4 only around six percent of patients live for five years after diagnosis5 an estimated 75-85% of liver cancers worldwide are hcc hepatocellular carcinoma making it the most common form of liver cancer4 in the past 5 years improved treatment has increased overall survival in patients with hcc although survival rates in advanced stages remain low6 with the number of people diagnosed with liver cancer continuing to rise globally it is critical that research and development of innovative treatments continues to progress in order to drive an improvement in overall survival and treatment outcomes for patients across all stages of the disease emmanuelle dochy oncology medical affairs at bayer prevention and

this project is part of the global oncology sustainability initiative at bayer which is primarily focused on improving access to quality cancer care and outcomes for large underserved communities in low- and middle-income countries that experience disparities in access advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician the main risk factors for hcc are chronic infection with hepatitis b or hepatitis c virus4 which is regarded as a potential precursor of a tumor as is cirrhosis of the liver a pathological change in the liver tissue involving shrinkage two to three decades can pass before the carcinoma develops there are additional risk factors that increase the likelihood of a tumor developing such as excessive alcohol consumption a common type of liver condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld which is closely associated with obesity and diabetes also may increase the risk of liver cancer nafld is the fastest growing cause of hcc in many parts of the world including the usa and parts of europe7 the incidence of nafld-related hcc is projected to increase dramatically by 2030 with increases of 82% 117% and 122% from 2016 in china france and the usa respectively7 symptoms usually do not occur until the disease has reached an advanced stage – and to some extent symptoms are relatively non-specific they include loss of appetite and nausea as well as pressure and pain in the upper abdomen the early detection of hcc is crucial for successful treatment because the tumor can be surgically removed in early-stage disease a blood test and an ultrasound examination can detect hcc computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri can then confirm a possible diagnosis and help detect the size shape and location of the tumor as well as potential metastases in advanced stages of the disease treatment of liver cancer approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with hcc are eligible for therapies that have the potential to cure the cancer such as resection or transplantation however in many cases diagnoses are made when the disease has progressed past the point of surgical resection called unresectable hcc uhcc and curative therapies are no longer feasible for patients8 recently significant progress has been made in the treatment of uhcc multiple treatment options that have the potential to extend lives are now available - both for patients who are receiving drug treatment for the first time first-line and for those receiving further drug treatment after initial treatment has stopped working second-line9 despite the availability of multiple options and expert guidelines recommending their use many patients are not receiving second-line treatment reducing their opportunity for improved survival11 immunotherapy combination approaches are for many patients the standard of care for first-line treatment however less than 30% of patients respond to this approach and for the majority of those who do respond to treatment their cancer will eventually relapse10 this is particularly relevant for those patients who are no longer responding well to first-line treatment and still have adequate liver function to benefit from second-line treatment in this context one of the most pressing challenges for physicians currently is the selection of the optimal sequence of second-line treatments real-world evidence among a broad population of patients with uhcc including those who have received immunotherapy shows that second-line treatments including tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis can extend patients’ lives and improve outcomes with a consistent safety profile12 it is important for patients to talk to their healthcare team about all available second-line treatment options after their first-line treatment has stopped working as well as any further treatment options beyond this will help to ensure that they get optimal outcomes across all lines of therapy for advanced liver cancer bayer treatment for hcc bayer’s key drug for advanced liver cancer is a type of targeted therapy called a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki that targets tumors and combats tumor growth in multiple different ways used by physicians for the treatment of advanced hcc in many countries around the world including the us countries of the eu china and japan it is approved as a second-line treatment option proven to extend patients’ lives and improve treatment outcomes1314 commitment to the liver cancer community in 2007 bayer introduced the first drug therapy approved by regulatory authorities for first-line treatment of patients with hcc in the decade following an important unmet need in hcc was to improve outcomes after disease progression on first-line treatment numerous other compounds failed to show survival benefit until 2017 when bayer’s second liver cancer drug received regulatory approval for second-line treatment of hcc patients after clinical trial results demonstrated that it extends patients’ lives this breakthrough made it the first treatment for advanced liver cancer to be approved in the second-line setting bayer remains committed to continuing research into new treatment options to improve survival for patients with hcc and to supporting the liver cancer patient community

prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide in 2018 an estimated 12 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and about 358000 died from the disease worldwide prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men1 the number of prostate cancer diagnoses is increasing probably as a result of the overall increase in life expectancy share: facebook twitter email linkedin the causes of prostate cancer are unknown there may be a hereditary disposition for the risk is greater when ones father or brother has had a tumor the risk of contracting the disease also increases with age men hardly ever develop prostate cancer before the age of fifty about the prostate gland the prostate gland is an inconspicuous organ the size of a walnut its primary function is to produce seminal fluid which transports the males semen through the urethra the prostate is also where the vas deferens and the ureter meet detecting prostate cancer early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms but more advanced cancers are sometimes detected because of symptoms they cause issues and especially pain during urination or ejaculation should be taken seriously the same applies to a frequent urge to urinate an inability to empty the bladder completely and finding blood in the semen or urine that said many of these symptoms are by no means a sure indication of cancer they can also be caused by infections or by a benign enlargement of the prostate which is very frequent a urologist can give a precise diagnosis most prostate cancers are diagnosed as a result of a screening blood test for prostate-specific antigen psa or a digital rectal exam an elevated concentration of psa can be the first sign of malignant disease in the prostate some guidelines recommend first undergoing a prostate mri and depending on the scoring of the mri images possibly a follow-up biopsy further tests including other medical imaging might be needed to support the exact diagnosis staging and monitoring for patients with malignancy treating prostate cancer there are more therapeutic options available to treat prostate cancer that has been diagnosed early these treatments range from surgery to radiation treatment to therapy using hormone-receptor antagonists ie substances that stop the formation of testosterone or prevent its effect at the target location these treatments can help stop or slow the growth of prostate carcinomas sometimes the above-mentioned therapies are combined advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician unmet need if the tumor has already reached an advanced stage there is no definitive cure this disease state is known as castration-resistant prostate cancer crpc this advanced form of prostate cancer is characterized by persistent high-level androgen receptor ar function and resistance to conventional anti-androgens the field of treatment options for castration-resistant patients is evolving rapidly there is no standard treatment for crpc patients who have rising prostate-specific antigen psa levels during androgen-deprivation therapy and no detectable metastases in men with progressive non-metastatic crpc a short psa doubling time has been consistently associated with reduced time to first metastasis and death a majority of men with crpc have symptomatic bone metastases resulting in pain skeletal events such as fractures or spinal cord compression and/or reduced survival in fact bone metastases lead to an increased risk of morbidity and death in patients with crpc bayer treatments for crpc bayer has developed an alpha-particle emitting radioactive therapeutic agent which is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of crpc and symptomatic bone metastases bayer is growing its prostate cancer portfolio with an androgen receptor inhibitor ari for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer nmcrpc despite recent advances in nmcrpc treatments there remains a unmet need for new therapeutic options that not only delay the time to metastases but also have a favorable safety profile which is important for these patients as they are generally asymptomatic bayer’s diagnostic options for prostate cancer every treatment starts with the right diagnosis imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging mri positron emission tomography pet ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography ct are used to create pictures of the inside of your body one or more such tests might be used to look for cancer in the prostate to help the doctor see the prostate better during certain procedures such as a prostate biopsy or certain types of prostate cancer treatment or to see if prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body which tests you might need will depend on the situation bayer’s radiology portfolio ranges from contrast media to devices that support radiologists in their mission to provide early diagnosis and targeted treatment sources: 1 globocan 2018: estimated cancer incidence

beneath the retina as a result of local disturbances in retina metabolism share: facebook twitter email linkedin age-related macular degeneration – dangerous but almost unknown the best-case scenario is that as you grow older you become more experienced knowledgeable wise – and farsighted however an estimated 196 million people globally live with age-related macular degeneration 104 million of whom 53% have moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness from more severe forms of the condition1 this dangerous disease is almost unknown to the general public yet it is the most common cause of severe visual impairment and blindness among people over the age of 65 in developed countries the incidence of age-related macular degeneration will go on growing dramatically as societies continue to age women are more frequently affected than men the initial symptoms of macular degeneration the first sign of age-related macular degeneration can be when straight lines suddenly look bent the disease usually starts in one eye but the second is also highly likely to be affected later further indications of macular degeneration can emerge when reading for example where the patient fixes his/her eyes the letters become blurred and only an indistinct blob can still be seen this blob grows in size over time with the result that sufferers can for example see a clock but not what time it is or they can recognize a persons outline but not his/her facial features different forms of the disease dry age-related macular degeneration amd is the most common form of the disease it only progresses slowly so that the patients loss of vision remains limited the wet form of macular degeneration about 10 to 15 percent of all amd cases causes much more serious restrictions of vision it is caused by tissue fluid and blood seeping from pathologically changed blood vessels into the macula leading to edemas swellings caused by fluid accumulations in addition new diseased blood vessels form in the choroid under the retina so that thickness of the retina is an important parameter of how active the disease is as a result the nerve cells of the retina gradually die off and central vision can be lost within just a few years if there is hemorrhaging it may even be lost completely at once an active substance against wet amd more and more medicines that inhibit a specific growth factor known as vegf vascular endothelial growth factor are used today in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration this messenger substance usually stimulates the formation of new blood vessels vegf inhibition is also the basic mechanism used by an new active substance developed by bayer and the us firm regeneron pharmaceuticals this substance can prevent blindness in people with wet age-related macular degeneration amd it is a protein that is injected into the eye there it inhibits not only vegf but also another messenger substance involved in the abnormal formation of new blood vessels and its fateful consequences progressive blindness can be stopped in this way and not only that: because the substance causes existing edemas and pathologically formed new blood vessels in the choroid to recede some of the photoreceptor cells that have not yet been completely destroyed can be saved – and visual acuity can even improve in some patients in 2013 bayers anti-vegf therapy was first approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration wet amd in canada it is now approved in many countries around the world including the united

also called a vector - is needed the most promising carriers for genes used in gene therapy and this might sound surprising are viruses but then transporting genetic material into cells is what viruses do best however not all viruses are created equal: adeno-associated viruses aavs are uniquely suited to deliver healthy genes to the cells that need them in contrast to other viruses aavs are not known to cause disease in humans and they do not replicate on their own making them the perfect one-time shuttles to deliver gene content for use in gene therapy the viral dna is removed and only the protein shell or capsid of these non-pathogenic viruses is used depending on what cells need to be addressed different types of aav serotypes can be used which are either naturally occurring or re-engineered some serotypes for example target liver cells while others enter retina cells or muscle cells this allows for a targeted therapy aav capsids are then filled with the functioning gene and a promoter a promoter is a short dna sequence that acts as a “switch” telling the gene when and where to start the process leading to synthesizing a protein and how much of a protein is needed for the cell to function properly promoters can be artificially designed to regulate the activity of a gene with a high level of selectivity: these are called synthetic promoters the role of synthetic promoters is to control gene activation with precision so that specific genetic pathways can be targeted in specific cells in the body addressing specific diseases once these aav capsids are filled with the genes they can be injected into a patient’s body from there they make their way to the intended cells and begin producing the missing proteins treating the “untreatable” the effect on a patient’s situation may be enormous once the genes are in the cells they often remain there for years and since the cells are then functioning as they should the illness may practically non-existent during this time aav therapeutics have shown promise to restore blood clotting in people with hemophilia vision in patients with leber’s congenital amaurosis a rare form of inherited blindness and to stop the progression of spinal muscular atrophy in babies delivering true breakthrough innovation to patients and the development of aav technology is only beginning in 2019 the us fda released a report predicting that by 2025 10 to 20 new cell and gene products will be approved yearly giving hope to patients who are currently still suffering from “untreatable” diseases share: facebook twitter email linkedin

cells ipsc have the potential to treat illnesses such as cancer parkinson’s disease or cardiovascular diseases in a more targeted and sustainable way and could even prevent their development for many patients cell therapy is therefore a source of hope in medical research revolution in the petri dish: induced pluripotent stem cells ipsc stem cells are the all-rounders of the body all types of tissue are formed from them making them particularly valuable a few years ago reprogramming of adult cells by japanese researcher and nobel laureate shinya yamanaka sparked a revolution in the world of research up until that point the purpose of a cell within the body had been considered unchangeable because even though the entire genome is contained in every cell skin or never cells for example can no longer access all parts of it today a biological trick see infographic makes it possible to reprogram adult stem cells into the state of pluripotent stem cells these so-called induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs can theoretically be differentiated into any type of cell and therefore any tissue type small cell big effect: how ipscs help in research working with ipscs and the cells differentiated from them offers a broad range of possibilities to researchers: they can artificially reconstruct entire organs from their various components cell types even making it possible to simulate diseases in the organs ipscs are used to create organ cells – nerve cells myocardial or liver cells – that show classical symptoms of disease thus illnesses – from parkinson’s to cardiovascular diseases and even cancer – can be simulated in the petri dish specific genetic damage can also be created with ipscs it is possible to generate models of patients suffering from certain genetic defects and the resulting illnesses testing of substances in the diseased cells enables researchers to examine new therapeutic approaches and the effects of potential active substances another possible use: with cardiomyocytes created from induced stem cells it is possible to gain information at an early stage about possible side effects of active substances that might become dangerous for a patient’s cardiac function for all purposes: ipscs are useful in pharmaceutical research and regenerative medicine besides drug research stem cell-based approaches are also very promising in the field of regenerative medicine for instance ipscs could be differentiated into cells which are defective in a patient eg dopaminergic neurons in the case of parkinson’s disease these cells can be transplanted into the patient and help halt the progression of the disease or even bring about a cure in addition specific genetic modifications can be used to minimize or completely prevent rejection reactions in the patient just the beginning: stem cells herald a new era in medical research but all of these are just mere hints at the overall potential of cell therapy in the future even more efficient and personalized treatment options will be available especially in combination with other revolutionary medical technologies and procedures through the integration of state-of-the-art procedures in cell biology and genome editing for instance it is possible to create a whole new generation of cellular therapies the prevention of cancer using vaccines is also boosted by cell therapy approaches the latest methods include injecting ipscs that are genetically matched with the receiver but are unable to reproduce this means that the immune system can be trained for a wide range of cancer-specific points of attack – and ultimately be enabled to fight cancer at an early stage all of this is an indicator for the potential of cell therapies for a huge variety of diseases and

safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs pharmacogenetics is viewed as a highly important area for improving drug therapy as it takes into account the genetic differences in the response to drugs the importance of genes for the success of a therapy a patients genetic dispositions play a special role in the context of biomarkers individual differences in a persons genetic makeup can affect how well a drug works or is tolerated pharmacogenetics is the science that studies the relationship between a persons genetic dispositions and the bodys individual response to a drug at bayer too pharmacogenetic findings have an impact at various stages of the development process dna variations influence a drug’s effect some patients give dna samples in the course of clinical trials on the basis of individual agreements to enable researchers to determine such differences polymerase chain reaction pcr a process that was honored with the nobel prize in chemistry in 1993 is used to reproduce by adding the enzyme dna polymerase a dna segment that is known to be responsible for the production of the relevant receptors the segment is then examined in robot-based serial tests in a process similar to high-throughput screening this enables the researchers to determine whether certain variations in this gene segment correlate with a stronger or weaker effect of the drug or perhaps with its tolerability if the dna building block that is responsible for the drugs effect is not known the scientists at bayer may track it down via the technology of sequencing in which the order of the building blocks on the patient gene relevant to the disease is compared with the normal sequence in the human genome any deviating building blocks are then further examined by pcr the results of these tests after being pseudonymized contribute to the study data if it turns out that certain elements of the genetic makeup are preventing the drug from having an effect physicians can conduct corresponding tests prior to treatment to ensure that only patients with prospects of a positive drug effect are treated and the others are spared a potentially unsuccessful treatment it is also possible to measure correlations between genetic patterns and the rate at which the drug is broken down thus providing valuable insights on the safety and proper dosage of the drug strict data protection researchers hope that pharmacogenetics will lead to therapies in which the active ingredient and dosage are tailored to a patients individual genetic

verification logo against counterfeit drugs background information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs precision medicine takes into account differences between individual patients and seeks to take advantage of them with the aim to find the right drug for the right patient at the right time the right drug for the right patient disease processes differ from person to person; the effects of drugs also vary individual differences between people – such as genes or age – influence not only the onset of diseases but also how drugs are absorbed and metabolized in the body researchers hope that individually customized therapies will be able to improve a patients response rate to a chosen treatment reduce side effects and under certain circumstances shorten the treatment period – depending on the type of disease involved no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution for cancer precisely coordinated treatment approaches are invaluable especially in oncology cancer occurs in countless forms and every tumor has different biochemical and genetic preconditions it is therefore almost impossible to develop effective one-size-fits-all treatments for cancer as we now know in the field of cancer therapy the response rate to some treatments is only around 20 percent which means that only one in five patients can be helped researchers are therefore trying to find personalized solutions on the one hand this means developing drugs that target specific types of tumor the more precisely a drug sets its sights on the cancer cells the more powerful is its effect on the disease and the lower the risk of side effects – a great advantage over conventional chemotherapies which also attack healthy body tissue and subject the patient to a lot of suffering on the other hand the scientists want to develop specific tests that will enable them to assess – even before starting treatment – whether a drug has a good chance of success against a patients individual form of cancer using tumor markers to assess effectiveness so-called tumor markers are often the key to a precise diagnosis and a decision in favor of certain treatment for cancer these markers are particular characteristics of cancer cells eg certain proteins on the cell surface or inside the cells that make it possible to specifically detect tumors and measure the seriousness of the illness or the patients response to treatment however modern drugs that target specific cancers such as therapeutic antibodies can only be effective if a patient actually has the corresponding tumor marker in many cases therefore researchers are developing an additional diagnostic procedure parallel to the actual therapeutic agent – a field where bayer is working in close collaboration with external partners these diagnostic tools aim to detect the tumor markers in samples of blood tissue or dna before the therapy begins in this way the patients who have a good chance of successful treatment can be identified early on during the therapy these diagnostic markers also make it possible to directly monitor therapeutic success ie they indicate whether and how well a patient is responding to the drug for patients without the specific tumor marker the corresponding therapy would in all probability not be an effective weapon against cancer the tumor-marker test can save them the burden of what would probably be an unsuccessful course of treatment or enable an early shift to drugs that might be more promising benefits for all sides in order to foster the potential of personalized medicine bayer wants to develop its own biomarker strategy for every active substance in its development pipeline in particular this effort is currently being implemented in all oncology projects wherever the scientific possibilities allow biomarkers are to be identified and test methods developed the hope is that in future this will make it possible to already identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a new therapeutic approach in time for clinical trials bayer also plans to extend the personalized medicine approach and the parallel development of both therapies and biomarkers to cardiovascular research projects since here too the individualized approach seems to offer good prospects of improving patient outcomes experts expect personalized medicine to play an increasingly important role in the future – especially since this approach creates added value for all sides in the healthcare industry an individually customized therapy benefits not only patients but also physicians by making it easier to choose the right therapy regulatory authorities by making risk-benefit assessment more precise and payers

bayer conducts clinical trials in accordance with the international guidelines the current national and local laws and regulations and the highest medical scientific and ethical principles the internal processes for the planning and conduct of clinical trials are implemented by bayer worldwide – regardless whether studies are conducted in europe the usa or in other countries to ensure that all guidelines are strictly followed and implemented bayer has in place an extensive quality system and quality standards a clinical study is conducted according to a research plan known as the study protocol the protocol is designed to answer specific research questions as well as to safeguard the health of participants it contains information on the reason for conducting the study who may participate in the study the eligibility criteria the number of participants needed the schedule of tests procedures or drugs and their dosages the lenh of the study and what information will be gathered about the participants of the clinical trials bayer adheres worldwide to the highest ethical standards when conducting clinical trials dr rita darkow head r&d quality bayer ag finally a standardized procedure followed worldwide by pharmaceutical companies such as bayer is the signature of the informed consent document by the trial participants this process makes sure that potential clinical trial participants understand the risks of potential benefits of and alternatives to the study this document must be signed before entering a study to show that the patient or their legal representative was given information on risks potential benefits and alternatives understands it and agrees to participate as well as to the use of his personal data related to the study signing the document and providing consent cannot be considered to be a contract participants may withdraw from a study at any time even if the study is not over and at no detriment to their future standard medical care the key role of ethics committee before initiating a clinical study besides formally submitting to regulatory agencies in all countries involved bayer is bound to seek written approval from ethics committees also referred to as institutional review boards the ethics committee considers ethical legal and scientific aspects together with the benefit/risk profile of the proposed trial when deciding on approval the ethics committee consists of members from a broad range of disciplines and acts as an independent review body completely separate from the pharmaceutical company that is sponsoring the trial as part of its review process the ethics committee also evaluates if the proposed facility or institution together with the clinical researcher are suitably qualified to conduct the planned research study the workings and procedures of the ethics committees are subject to inspection at any time by the responsible health authorities selection of clinical study centers when selecting countries and clinical study centers bayers primary considerations include medical and regulatory aspects as well as the respective countrys medical infrastructure this ensures that the investigating physicians bring the best medical and scientific expertise to the study this approach also takes into account that efficacy and tolerability of medicines sometimes vary in different ethnic groups owing to differences in the way the drug is metabolized further some health authorities may require that clinical trials include sites within their own country if a pharmaceutical company is seeking market approval of a new drug application quality system and quality standards at bayer all necessary clinical development processes which must be adhered to globally are described in detail in bayer‘s extensive quality system patient safety transparency of the clinical trial process and clinical data integrity are the cornerstones of our quality system through our internal process known as monitoring bayer as the sponsor of the clinical trial works with clinical research sites to ensure adherence to the agreed trial protocol that the protection of subjects is safeguarded and that the data generated is complete and accurate all aspects of the clinical development activities of bayer are audited by bayer‘s quality assurance group which works independently from the clinical development function the results of these audits provide management with assurance of the reliability and integrity of clinical data and that it has been generated in adherence to

innovative therapies bayer as a research-based pharmaceutical company focuses on the discovery and development of new treatment options for diseases with a high unmet medical need clinical studies represent an important part of the drug development process they are an indispensable tool to determine the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates before they can be used to treat illness the benefits and potential risks of new medicines must always be scientifically proven and well-documented the role of ethics in clinical studies the ethics of research on people and clinical trials is an area of public concern and interest pharmaceutical companies that conduct such research have been subject to criticism for a lack of transparency a further line of criticism suggests that studies with approved and launched products are mainly undertaken for marketing purposes or are conducted abroad in an effort to cut costs or avoid strict regulations ethical conduct in clinical trials is based on the helsinki declaration an ethical standard in place since 1964 which governs research on people since then supplementary standards regulations and ethical codes have been further developed and

sustainably inspiring creativity and improving health the nutrient gap initiative report a side effect medical counterfeits recognizing fakes eu verification logo against counterfeit drugs background information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs you wanna know more about clinical trials you can find the answers to eleven frequently asked questions in our faq below 1 what are clinical trials and why are they important clinical trials are research studies conducted with people who volunteer to take part in testing how well new medical approaches work each study answers scientific questions and tries to find better ways to prevent screen for diagnose or treat a disease 2 who sponsors clinical trials clinical trials are sponsored or funded by a variety of organizations or individuals such as physicians medical institutions foundations voluntary groups and pharmaceutical companies in addition to federal agencies trials can take place in a variety of locations such as hospitals universities doctors offices or community clinics 3 how are participants protected research with people is conducted according to strict scientific and ethical principles every clinical trial has a protocol which acts like a recipe for conducting the trial the protocol describes what will be done in the study how it will be conducted and why each part of the study is necessary the same protocol is used by every doctor or research center taking part in the trial to ensure the safety of those in the study various approvals are required; these vary depending on the country but usually include a central review by a government department and also locally the review ensures participants are treated humanely and ethically and whether the likely benefit of the treatment is worth its risk 4 what are eligibility criteria and why are they important each studys protocol has guidelines for who can or cannot participate in the study these guidelines called eligibility criteria describe characteristics that must be shared by all participants the criteria differ from study to study they may include age gender medical history and current health status enrolling participants with similar characteristics ensures that the results will be due to what is under study and not other factors in this way eligibility criteria help researchers achieve accurate and meaningful results these criteria also make certain that people who could be made worse by participating in the study are not exposed to the risk 5 what is informed consent informed consent is a process by which people learn the important facts about a clinical trial to help them decide whether to participate this information includes details about what is involved such as the purpose of the study the tests and other procedures used in the study and the possible risks and benefits in addition to talking with the doctor or nurse people receive a written consent form explaining the study people who agree to take part in the study are asked to sign the informed consent form however signing the form does not mean people must stay in the study people can leave the study at any time - either before the study starts or at any time during the study or the follow-up period the informed consent process continues throughout the study if new benefits risks or side effects are discovered during the study the researchers must inform the participants they may be asked to sign new consent forms if they want to stay in the study 6 where do clinical trials take place clinical trials take place in doctors offices medical centers community hospitals and clinics clinical trials may include participants at one or two highly specialized centers or they may involve hundreds of locations at the same time 7 how are clinical trials conducted clinical trials are usually conducted in a series of steps called phases preclinical trials are early experiments performed in the lab prior to being tested in humans this early research helps to identify potential treatments that are unsafe or ineffective phase i trials are the first step in testing a new approach in humans in these studies researchers evaluate what dose is safe how a new agent should be given by mouth injected into a vein or injected into the muscle for example and how often researchers watch closely for any harmful side effects phase i trials usually enroll a small number of patients and take place at only a few locations phase ii trials study the safety and effectiveness of an agent or intervention and evaluate how it affects the human body phase ii studies usually focus on a particular medical condition phase iii trials compare a new agent or intervention or new use of a standard one with the current standard therapy participants are randomly assigned to the standard group or the new group usually by computer this method called randomization helps to avoid bias and ensures that human choices or other factors do not affect the studys results in most cases studies move into phase iii testing only after they have shown promise in phases i and ii phase iii trials may include hundreds of people across the country or globally phase iv trials are conducted to further evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of a treatment they usually take place after the treatment has been approved for standard use several hundred to several thousand people may take part in a phase iv study these studies are less common than phase i ii or iii trials 8 what happens when a clinical trial is over after a phase i or ii trial the researchers decide whether to move on to the next phase or stop testing the agent or intervention because it was not safe or effective when a phase iii trial is completed the researchers look at the data and decide whether the results have medical importance the results of clinical trials are often published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and at company or other public websites like clinicalstudyresultsorg on the internet peer review is a process by which experts review the report before it is published to make sure the analysis and conclusions are sound if the results are particularly important they may be featured by the media and discussed at scientific meetings and by patient advocacy groups before they are published once a new approach has been proven safe and effective in a clinical trial it may become standard practice standard practice is a currently accepted and widely used approach 9 what are some of the benefits of taking part in a clinical trial the benefits of participating in a clinical trial include the following: participants have access to promising new approaches that are often not available outside the clinical trial setting the approach being studied may be more effective than the standard approach participants receive regular and careful medical attention from a research team that includes doctors and other health professionals participants may be the first to benefit from the new method under study results from the study may help others in the future 10 what are some of the possible risks associated with taking part in a clinical trial the possible risks of participating in a clinical trial include the following: new drugs or procedures under study are not always better than the standard care to which they are being compared new treatments may have side effects or risks that doctors do not expect or that are worse than standard care participants in randomized trials will not be able to choose the approach they receive depending on countries and health insurance systems health insurance and managed care providers may not cover all patient care costs in a study participants may be required to make more visits to the doctor than they would if they were not in the clinical trial 11 what are some questions people might ask their health care provider before entering a clinical trial it is important for people to ask questions before deciding to enter a clinical trial some questions people might want to ask their doctor or nurse are below the trial what is the purpose of the trial why do the researchers think the approach being tested may be effective has it been tested before who is sponsoring the trial who has reviewed and approved the trial what are the medical credentials and experience of the researchers and other study personnel how are the trial results and safety of participants being monitored how long will the trial last how will the results be shared possible risks and benefits what are the possible short-term benefits what are the possible long-term benefits what are the short-term risks such as side effects what are the possible long-term risks what other treatment options are available how do the possible risks and benefits of the trial compare with those of other options participation and care what kinds of treatment medical tests or procedures will the participants have during the study how often will they receive the treatments tests or procedures will treatments tests or procedures be painful if so how can the pain be controlled how do the tests in the study compare with what people might receive outside the study will participants be able to take their regular medications while in the clinical trial where will the participants receive their medical care will they be in a hospital if so for how long who will be in charge of the participants care will they be able to see their own doctors how long will participants need to stay in the study will there be follow-up visits after the study personal issues how could being in the study affect the participants daily lives what support is available for participants and their families can potential participants talk with people already enrolled in the study cost issues will participants have to pay for any treatment tests or other charges if so what will the approximate charges be will my health care insurance provider have to take over parts of the cost who can help me if i require more information regarding financial issues cost issues can depend on individual regulations in countries and health care insurance providers share: facebook twitter email linkedin

brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs looking at the big picture: by screening interactions between compounds and proteins in their native cellular environments chemoproteomics is a new approach to drug discovery and opens up opportunities to develop novel treatments for currently intractable diseases – a key to the “undruggable space” since their early days in the second half of the 19th century small molecule drugs smols targeting disease-related proteins have become a mainstay of the pharmaceutical industry and today treatments based on smols make up about 90 percent of all drugs sold worldwide despite this the percentage of the human proteome – the entire set of proteins that can be expressed by a cell at any given time – that can be targeted by these drugs has remained comparatively small the great majority of proteins are still considered “undruggable” due to their lack of clearly defined binding pockets that can be effectively targeted by small molecules or limitations of chemistry to design suitable compounds this “undruggable space” contains many proteins involved in the development of a variety of diseases and approaches to address this undruggable space are critical for furthering the scope of modern drug discovery chemoproteomics offers a way to overcome this obstacle and access these previously “undruggable” proteins by rethinking the drug discovery process it opens-up new treatment options for some of the most serious diseases affecting millions of patients all over the world reinventing drug discovery traditionally the process of drug discovery has followed one of two trajectories: in classical pharmacology or phenotypic drug discovery pdd different small molecules were introduced into cellular or animal models of specific diseases and screened for desirable changes in the disease phenotype only after a therapeutic effect was observed for a compound and often after drugs were approved would researchers attempt to identify the protein target responsible for the drugs’ effects target identification for drugs resulting from phenotypic screening is a long and often unsuccessful process and many popular drugs are still in use that act through unclear or unknown targets in the late 20th century a new approach called target-based drug discovery tdd tried to overcome these limitations this process also called “reverse pharmacology” begins with the identification of potentially promising target proteins followed by the search for compounds that modulate the function of the target with the help of high-throughput screening methods but this approach also has limitations as the majority of disease-related proteins cannot be addressed by tdd leaving a large number of targets undruggable chemoproteomics in particular activity-based protein profiling abpp is yet again rethinking the drug discovery process and offers a key to unlock the undruggable space instead of beginning the search for new drugs by focusing on a specific compound pdd or target tdd this new approach takes an unbiased look at the entire human proteome using reactivity-based chemical probes and high-resolution mass spectrometry to screen the interactions of different compounds with all of the approximately 20000 proteins coded by the human genome in their native cellular environments this approach comes with various advantages over both pdd and tdd by observing interactions of individual compounds with the entire proteome abpp has the potential to exponentially expand the druggable space by highlighting previously undiscovered binding sites that might function as starting points for new treatments of diseases abpp provides researchers with both the compound and the target involved in a binding event up front eliminating the challenging search for targets what is left is the biological step of the drug discovery process: identifying whether the binding event has a potential therapeutic effect the return of the covalent modifier the biggest advantage of a chemoproteomics drug discovery approach like abpp however is that it allows for the targeted identification of one of the most powerful kinds of small molecule drugs: covalent modifiers forming a specific and often irreversible bond with proteins covalent modifiers are characterized by a higher potency and a longer-lasting effect than other small molecules and can target shallower binding pockets and even protein complexes the concept of covalent modifiers is not new the first medication of this kind aspirin was synthesized by bayer in the 1890s since then covalent drugs have had an immense impact on human health in 2009 three of the ten most successful medicines sold in the us were covalent drugs and according to estimates by nature the 26 covalent drugs for which data is available collectively account for more than 33 billion us dollars in worldwide sales many of the covalent drugs available today were discovered by chance as pharmaceutical companies have hardly engaged actively in the development of new covalent drugs in the past owing to their complexity and risk of failure but with chemoproteomics a new era is dawning for covalent drug and bayer is aspiring to be a leader in this field joining forces to expand the druggable space modern chemoproteomics tools allow us to develop novel targeted covalent modifiers by taking a broad look at the entire proteome and mitigating many of the risks currently involved in drug discovery utilizing abpp allows us to rapidly expand the druggable space and bring new first-in-class precision treatments to patients suffering from as-yet intractable diseases bayer has invested significantly in chemoproteomics and the development of targeted covalent modifiers externally as well as in-house with the acquisition of vividion therapeutics the company added a player with unmatched pioneering achievements in the field of activity-based proteomics that brings with it not only an industry-leading chemoproteomics screening platform but also a library of cysteine-reactive small molecules that perfectly complements bayer’s own to date vividion’s technology has already proven its applicability pre-clinically in oncology and immune-related diseases and bayer is working to expand its capabilities into additional indications cornerstone of success will be a rich and modern smol library with diverse high-quality compounds to generate the leads for future clinical candidates within the framework of the “next generation library initiative” bayer is building such a modern diverse covalent compound library over the course of the last years we have synthesized more than 12000 high-quality covalent compounds and our unique fully automated synthesis platform will allow us to increase this number flexibly and cost-effectively to over 60000 in the near future and vividion’s proprietary library of over 15000 diverse covalent smols that are specifically designed to form covalent bonds with accessible cysteine residues in shallow protein binding pockets is a valuable asset for the chemoproteomics

effect medical counterfeits recognizing fakes eu verification logo against counterfeit drugs background information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs by utilizing the natural cellular disposal mechanism to degrade unwanted or harmful proteins protacs® could offer a radically different approach for the treatment of various diseases thereby expanding the druggable space this opens-up completely new possibilities in the development of new drugs traditionally many small molecule drugs follow the same basic mechanism of action to treat diseases: they inhibit the function of a target protein that has an active role in a disease to do so they require a tractable active binding site to occupy which will result in protein function inhibition like blocking its enzymatic activity but traditional small molecules can only block one single domain function of the protein which means that potential other functions remain intact and can continue to fuel disease processes this is one reason why it is assumed that traditional small molecule drugs can sufficiently address only a small percentage of the disease-causing proteins in the human proteome via the described mode of action the great majority of proteins remains in the so called “undruggable space” novel chemical modalities with a different mode of action such as protacs® however could offer a means to minimize this “undruggable space” using the cell’s own waste disposal system to treat disease protacs® – short for proteolysis targeting chimeras – do not delete proteins by themselves but instead utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system ups – the natural cellular protein degradation system – to break them down to do this protacs® molecules consist of two parts which are connected via a linker with one part the target binder protacs® bind to the specific protein like traditional small molecules do in contrast to small molecule drugs it is not required that this binding translates into inhibition of the protein function the other part of the protacs® engages with an enzyme called e3 ubiquitin ligase bringing the target protein and the e3 ligase in close proximity – connected via the protac consequently the e3 ligase tags the protein to mark it for degradation by the proteasome the cellular “waste disposal machine” that breaks down unneeded or damaged proteins 1/2 2/2 previous next because of their special mode of action protacs® offer a series of advantages compared to traditional small molecule drugs: for one they do not require to constantly occupy the functional site at the protein of interest to be effective also by removing the protein of interest all its functions are abrogated which could lead to additional pharmacological effects compared to a traditional small molecule moreover protacs® have the potential to create a longer-lasting therapeutic effect because they degrade a protein which consequently needs to be resynthesized by the cell to be operational again furthermore it is expected that they might require lower doses than traditional small molecules since they are released after their target protein has been degraded freeing them up to continue their mission this potentially enhances safety margins and the risk of drug resistance occurring overall these properties make protacs® a very attractive new approach for the development of novel treatment options especially diseases driven by an accumulation of disease proteins as is often common to cancer could potentially benefit at bayer we are also evaluating the protacs® technology for the development of next-generation medicines for patients with cardiovascular and gynecological diseases a new tool in the fight against diseases in the long run however protacs® are not expected to replace traditional small molecules modern approaches are currently reviving the potential of small molecules in various

robust demonstrating high potency and durability in the preclinical setting and we are keen to explore the full potential of this novel approach alongside other technologies like rna-targeting small

proteins involved in harmful disease processes cannot be targeted by drugs – they are “undruggable” targeting them at the level of rna could be the entry point yet into an unexplored universe of new treatment options for patients we are recruiting interested in joining our expert team in rna-targeting technology and smol applications find out about open positions keyword rna here small molecules smols have long been in the focus of modern medicine over the last century their advent revolutionized healthcare and improved the lives of patients all over the world most of today´s smols exert their function by binding to proteins thereby modulating their ability to catalyze biochemical reactions however a lot of proteins are difficult targets for smols since they do not possess defined binding sites that can be used for smol drug candidates and this is making them hard to drug or even “undruggable” a new and promising approach to solve this challenge may become possible in the future the development of new technologies has recently unlocked a new class of target molecules for the application of smols: ribonucleic acid or in short: rna taking aim at rna rna’s role in the development of many human diseases is well established as a central mediator of information transfer and gene regulation it is an essential component in all biological systems as it for example carries the instructions for protein synthesis to date rna remains more or less untargeted in conventional smol discovery due to the fact that for a long time it was not considered a potential target for smols one reason for this was its convoluted structures that comprise of single-stranded molecules folded into intricate secondary and tertiary structures this is why people used to compare the structure of an rna molecule with the random appearance of a cooked spaghetti this has changed: we now know that these structures are highly ordered and critical to how rna works and it is precisely these complicated secondary and tertiary structures that could make rna a viable target for smols today 1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4 previous next the process of targeting rna with smols appears quite similar to the more established targeting of proteins by binding to pockets in these rna structures smols can alter the way rna functions for example smols can modulate the function stability of messenger rnas leading to an increased or decreased production of a certain protein they can influence rna localization and alter translation patterns unlocking a universe of new targets targeting rna with smols could enable us to indirectly target proteins that are currently “undruggable” by preventing their synthesis this way the activity of many disease-related proteins could potentially be therapeutically altered in the future in addition we are taking aim at non-coding rna non-coding rna denotes those types of rna that have functions beyond protein coding and can influence disease by regulating cellular signal transduction pathways or the translation of other coding rnas it accounts for a vast portion of rna encoded by the human genome which means that targeting non-coding rna could potentially lead to a wealth of new therapeutic approaches that are currently out of reach for today’s medicine addressing these different biological mechanisms rna-targeting small molecules could access a universe of new targets and with that totally novel therapeutic approaches leading the change developing and establishing a novel game-changing technology platform for identification of rna-targeting smols is a big task that requires experience expertise and commitment at bayer we are now bringing together a team of experts whose sole focus is on the challenge of creating and developing rna-targeting smols and researching their potential applications on the basis of our next-generation cell biology technologies and our library of more than 4 million compounds we are

information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs medical imaging uses imaging technology to reveal structures inside the body this enables radiologists to diagnose diseases and monitor disease progression or a patient’s response to treatment this is why radiologists are often referred to as the ‘’doctor’s doctor’’ playing a crucial role from diagnosis to care advice for patients each body reacts differently to medicines therefore it is impossible to tell which medicine works best for you please consult your physician healing starts with finding finding a disease early on can have a great impact on treatment a radiologist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disease and injury using a range of medical imaging techniques including : x-ray ultrasound computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri positron emission tomography pet after interpreting the images the radiologist shares their recommendation with the treating doctor so that a treatment plan can be developed knowing the importance of an accurate diagnosis bayer has been committed to the field of radiology for almost 100 years and develops products and solutions that help enhance medical images and increase diagnostic confidence understanding diagnostic imaging techniques the type of imaging technique selected will depend on: suspected disease the part of the body being examined how quickly the images can be produced – this is relevant for example in emergency cases certain patient characteristics that might not permit a particular scan – for example during pregnancy computed tomography ct a ct scan combines several x-ray images taken from different angles providing more detailed information than a two-dimensional x-ray this type of scan can be particularly helpful in emergency situations as the images can be produced very quickly a ct scan may be carried out to: find and localize a tumor infection or blood clot detect diseases and monitor progression of conditions such as cancer and heart disease diagnose muscle and bone disorders such as bone tumors and fractures guide procedures such as surgery biopsy and radiation therapy monitor the impact of treatment detect internal injuries and internal bleeding ct scan: what to expect before the scan you may be given a contrast agent to help improve the quality of the images you will generally lie on a flat bed that passes into a scanner which consists of a ring that rotates around a section of the body at a time it is important to lie very still to ensure that the images are not blurred a ct scan generally takes between 10 and 20 minutes during a ct scan patients are briefly exposed to ionizing radiation recent technical advances have contributed to lowering the amount of radiation the radiologist will ensure that the lowest possible radiation dose is used to achieve a high-quality image magnetic resonance imaging mri mri is a type of medical imaging that can examine almost any part of the body including the brain and spinal cord bones and joints breasts heart and blood vessels and internal organs such as the uterus liver or prostate gland using strong magnetic field and radio waves it can produce extremely clear and detailed pictures of inside the body mri: what to expect mri machines are generally large cylinder with openings at both ends you will lie on a bed that is moved inside the scanner which is operated by a computer in a separate room to ensure the images are clear you will need to stay still during each scan which can take from a few seconds to several minutes at certain times during the procedure the mri scanner will make loud tapping sounds this is from the magnets inside the mri scanner being switched on and off quickly you will be offered earplugs or you may choose to listen to music through headphones during the scan the whole procedure will last between 15 and 90 minutes depending on the size of the area being scanned and the number of images being taken contrast agent a contrast agent is a clear liquid that is sometimes used to improve the quality of images produced by x-rays ct scans mri and sometimes ultrasound by making parts of the image more visible in the pictures contrast agents are injected into the body before the scan and are generally well tolerated by most patients contrast agent: what to expect a contrast agent might be given: by injection: a contrast agent is injected through a vein to help certain organs or blood vessels stand out in the scans by mouth: if your esophagus or stomach is being scanned you may need to swallow a liquid contrast agent by enema: a contrast agent may be inserted in your rectum to help visualize your intestines during the scan a small amount of contrast agent will be injected either by hand or by a pump called an ‘injector’ sometimes the contrast agent can cause mild side effects such as feeling warmth or being sick a skin rash a headache or dizziness in rare cases a contrast agent may cause medical issues or a more severe allergic reaction please inform the medical staff in case you are feeling unwell

verification logo against counterfeit drugs background information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs we are part of an industry that is lauded for producing innovative therapies that change patients’ lives it is an industry that has fostered incredible scientific development producing drugs to treat a range of conditions from heart failure and thrombosis to multiple cancer treatments we want to continue developing innovative treatments as efficiently as possible so we value collaboration with likeminded partners who share our quest to provide new options for patients here are some of the reasons why we partner: scouting co-creating and capturing innovation is essential to fulfill our mission of making a better life for people by impactful science win-win partnerships have the power to deliver on innovation we want to complement our comprehensive in-house skills and talents with the creativity and courage of excellent partners from academia and industry dr christian rommel member of the executive committee of bayer ags pharmaceuticals division and head of research and development to bring new treatments to patients quicker than before we will do whatever it takes to deliver solutions to patients for us innovation isn’t limited to the next major breakthrough therapy – we also celebrate the seemingly smaller successes because we know there are patients waiting for new ways in which they can live better partnering gives us the chance to establish scientific relationships across indications to foster scientific progress and benefits for patients our ultimate goal is always to provide more options for patients as fast and efficiently as possible our collaboration exemplifies how academic creativity and industrial drug development experiences can be perfectly combined prof hong wu dean of school of life sciences of peking university to extend our existing knowledge and expertise we are proud of our in-house expertise and we have scores of people who work hard to find new solutions to some of healthcare’s most challenging problems however we cannot possibly claim to know everything we welcome different forms of collaboration: from traditional licensing agreements or strategic alliances to public-private partnerships consortia or open innovation models by complementing our internal capabilities with the know-how of exceptional partners we have access to a vast pool of expertise that we can tap into to improve research and development of new medicines to speed up innovation we want to take advantage of the latest trends so we are flexible when it comes to how we foster medical innovation new models of collaboration have emerged and are rapidly increasing in number these new alliances are broad; they involve entire departments and even entire institutions by finding new and creative approaches to build upon and harness such knowledge we can speed up the time it takes to research and development innovative medicines to maintain connections to the global scientific community we are geographically flexible - that means that we go where the science is we have five innovation centers in some of the most vibrant cities across the world so we can maintain our local scientific networks and are looking for new collaborations all the time different ways of partnering industry-industry collaborations academic-industry collaborations innovation centers industry-industry collaborations why do we do it we don’t collaborate simply to enhance our geographic or commercial footprint but to pool expertise and portfolios sharing know-how can accelerate the research and development process and ensure that we bring drugs to patients faster than before what are the results bayer has dedicated departments that identify promising technologies and assets from other companies that have a strong potential for successful innovation these late stage collaborations focus on compounds in phase i studies and beyond one such example is our collaboration with orion corporation which was established in 2014 to develop a drug candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer the product has been successfully brought to market in the first indication of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer while additional clinical trials are currently ongoing in other disease stages the global partnership with orion is an excellent example of capitalizing on the expertise of two partners to accelerate the development of promising oncology treatment options we also partner with companies at an earlier development stage for example since 2012 bayer has been in collaboration with evotec an external innovation drug discovery and development company the partnership began with the research and development of new treatment options for the neglected disease of endometriosis in 2016 we have also entered into a partnership to research and develop drugs for the treatment of kidney diseases and in 2019 for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome academic-industry collaborations why do we do it the number of collaborations between industry and academia or consortia is increasing rapidly such alliances are broad and contribute to entire therapeutic areas not only single compounds and often last for years what are the results bayer now has over 30 collaborations with academic institutions one such example is our work together with the renowned broad institute of mit and harvard one of the leading global research institutes in biomedicine the partnership began in 2013 with a focus on finding new ways to tackle cancer in 2015 we began a new collaboration focusing on heart and blood cardiovascular diseases which uses insights from human genetics to help create new therapies in 2018 we opened a joint precision cardiology laboratory to further our combined research of new ways to treat patients with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure we also partner with consortia such as the structural genomics consortium and are very active in the innovative medicines initiative these collaborations do not necessarily target the development of specific drugs but rather investigate new research methods we have played an active role in the innovative medicines initiative imi participating in 40 projects including: the cancer-id project aims to develop new and less invasive ways of examining cancer cells and genetic material from tumors by analyzing blood samples for clues to what treatment is needed and how well drugs are working we are part of imi’s big data for better outcomes bd4bo program which generates knowledge data and methodologies needed to support the transition towards more outcome-focused sustainable healthcare systems in europe imi’s eupati project developed patient engagement program that includes an in-depth training course online toolbox and national platforms which has boosted patient empowerment in europe and beyond by improving the way we conduct our r&d activities we make sure that developing drugs for our patients is carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible innovation centers why we do it bayer has established “innovation centers” in close proximity to leading academic institutions worldwide by decreasing the practice of maintaining internal traditional r&d infrastructures and by increasing external collaboration through these centers academic and company scientists can combine their expertise to solve r&d challenges we hope that these centers will become a hub of scientific excellence and innovation integrating internal and external expertise in short by remaining an active member of the scientific community and its various networks we can share and gain knowledge that helps us in our r&d activities what are the results we have innovation centers in various locations around the world including japan established in 2014 in osaka the task of the innovation center japan icj is to find research cooperation projects throughout the country the projects usually focus on diseases of considerable unmet medical need and help to advance the development of innovative treatments bayer has also set up “colaborators” which offer young life-sciences companies the opportunity to open their research laboratories either on the campuses of or in close proximity to the pharmaceuticals division of bayer each colaborator follows an incubator concept which offers laboratory space alongside access to the company’s research expertise and infrastructure as well as a first point of contact in the search for partnering options in the pharmaceutical industry sources: 1 national cancer institute nci

instruct the body’s cells on how to make proteins critical to their function many diseases and disorders are caused by the faulty expression of proteins from faulty or missing genes what is gene therapy science and technology our strategy gene therapy factsheet download gene therapy turns what has long only been wishful thinking into a reality: addressing an inherited or acquired disease at its root cause by using genetic material as a treatment this can mean for instance the removal or change of a faulty or missing gene or the introduction of genetic material into certain cells of the patient in this sense gene therapy represents a paradigm-shift in how healthcare systems can address diseases as it has the potential to address areas of high unmet medical need where current treatment options so far can only provide limited or insufficient care for patients facts about gene therapy 4:59 00:00 science and technology for introducing genetic material gene therapies add a functional copy of the gene that is faulty or missing to the patient’s cells this copy will then promote the production of the desired protein in the patient’s body which can be for example an enzyme a blood coagulation factor or other this way the therapeutic gene helps the cells to function correctly and the functional protein can be restored for this kind of gene therapy the genetic material is only introduced to some cells in the patient’s body like liver cells for example to be successful and ensure targeted and safe delivery of the genetic material the gene therapy product requires three components including a vector a promoter and the transgene unlike small molecules for example genes cannot simply be ingested or injected since they would be cleared or broken down after entering the bloodstream unprotected instead genes require a vector a kind of shuttle that gets them to the targeted cell the most common vectors used in current fda-approved gene therapy treatments are modified viruses though it might sound paradoxical at first viruses are perfect for this – after all they are nature’s experts at delivering genetic material to specific cells before using the virus as a vector its dna is removed leaving only the shell also known as capsid which is then filled with copies of the healthy genetic material viruses used that way do not cause diseases but make for suitable gene therapy vectors beyond viral vectors researchers are also investigating other ways to deliver gene therapies such as lipid nanoparticles of the other two components the transgene holds all the genetic information for the cells to deliver the therapeutic response once packed into the vector it travels to the target cell and delivers the correct instructions the promoter on the other hand is needed to drive the expression of the transgene in the target cells it is basically a piece of dna sitting in front of the therapeutic transgene and can be designed to act like a switch regulating the activity of the transgene in selected tissues of interest whether viral or not once the shuttles are carrying their genetic load they can be injected into the body of the patient there they find the intended cell and deliver the genes which then make the cell function as it should – potentially stopping an illness for many years ending it or even reversing it with only one treatment our strategy in 2020 bayer acquired the industry-leader and now wholly owned subsidiary asklepios biopharmaceutical askbio a pioneer in gene therapy holding more than 750 patents relating to the technology field

information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs dna is the instruction manual for life on earth it encodes the fundamental properties of an organism and is passed down from cell to cell from generation to generation most of the time this happens without any issue in some cases however mistakes occur during the process leading to changes in the dna sequence these might be without effect or harmless but they can also cause one of the thousands of rare monogenetic and sometimes life-threatening diseases what is gene editing science and technology our strategy gene editing factsheet download with technologies like crispr that build on nobel prize winning science gene editing allows for the targeted manipulation of genetic material making it possible to correct such changes in the sequence when they cause disease while gene editing is one of the youngest of the c approaches the technology is advancing rapidly meaning that novel therapies might be just around the corner facts about gene editing 7:09 00:00 science and technology in healthcare gene editing technologies enable the precise manipulation of genetic material to achieve a therapeutic effect this includes a wide range of applications such as the correction of mutations that cause disease the addition of therapeutic genes to specific sites in the dna and the removal of deleterious genetic sequences because of this diversity one can think of the technology as a swiss army knife – an invaluable tool with a diversity of functionalities for healthcare applications gene editing has a dual role: it is used as an enabling technology for cell therapy and also has huge potential as a stand-alone therapeutic technology as an enabling technology for cell therapy gene editing can help to alter and therefore improve therapeutic cells which will allow the development of next generation cell therapies with increased safety and/or efficacy for example increased potency and persistence or reduced immunogenicity this could enable cell therapy application to a larger patient pool or a broader indication range therapeutic gene editing on the other hand is a specific type of gene therapy that is just starting to emerge research is ongoing to create such gene editing therapies that can combat cancer blood diseases infectious diseases and rare inherited genetic diseases one example of a gene editing technology is crispr which is currently being explored in clinical trials as a therapeutic modality for diabetes sickle cell and many other diseases the ability to manipulate dna with unrivaled precision makes gene editing one of the most versatile approaches to treating

specifically 20% of their long-term incentives are linked to success in meeting our access and sustainability goals additionally an independent sustainability council with nine internationally recognized experts advises our board of management and other functions within bayer in all sustainability matters it was founded in may 2020 access to medicine strategy living up against our vision “health for all” requires having clear patient access goals aiming to provide access to as many patients as possible we have established ambitious and auditable targets aligned to the un’s sdgs // enabling 100 million women in lmic to gain access to modern contraception by 2030by doing so we want to improve women’s health rights and economic status as a step towards increasing gender equality sdg 5 // broaden access to our pharmaceutical products in lmicenabling worldwide patient access to our medicines is one of our key goals at bayer sdg 3 with this in mind we have changed the way we price our pharmaceutical products internationally and implement programs that reduce the out-of-pocket burden at an individual level these targets are designed to kick off a broader patient access agenda along the entire value chain of the company our access-to medicine strategy is built on four cornerstones: empowering women globally: access to quality healthcare and gender equality are key indicators for social and economic prosperity for over 50 years bayer has been supporting education programs and rights-based family planning in more than 130 countries particularly with access to modern contraception as a global market leader in women’s health bayer is stepping up with the goal to help provide 100 million women in low- and middle-income countries with affordable modern contraceptives by 2030 inclusive and sustainable growth: we are transforming our business by introducing flexible tailored approaches to reduce the burden of cost on patients by working to expand reimbursed access through our equitable pricing strategy tailored patient affordability programs paps help patients overcome financial obstacles to access the treatments they need we believe in inclusive growth approaches from which many patients worldwide will benefit health system strenhening and capacity building: improving access to healthcare requires more than just making products available in close collaboration with local and global partners bayer supports programs which are in line with our access goal without pursuing commercial intentions by bringing our knowledge capabilities resources and networks in line with local needs we can make a difference in achieving the united nations sdgs see text box on partnerships product development with a structured access planning approach: access planning is an integral part of the product development and commercialization process it is critical that development programs consider patient access early on always with the aim for rapid and sustainable access to innovative medicine globally bayer has developed a new structured access planning approach which is designed to help find the best possible strategies for all pipeline products particularly for low- and middle-income countries with a high burden of disease while patient access has no geographical limitations in principle we need to ensure that we don’t miss patients in low-and-middle-income countries lmics as well as underprivileged populations in high-income countries from a product scope perspective the beforementioned cornerstones apply to bayer’s full portfolio as a research- based company bayer’s focus will be on our innovative products to be made available to all patients benefitting from them our access commitments the following commitments on patient access are there to help activating our access-to-medicine strategy bayer aims to prepare a holistic patient access plan for all pipeline assets no later than in phase ii the

fighting counterfeit drugs in collaboration with our partners we aim to support more patients in low- and middle-income countries lmics to access our medicines for a healthier global society share: facebook twitter email linkedin with a growing population worldwide and increased life expectancy healthcare is more important than ever the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating impact illnesses can have without access to medical care treatments and vaccines according to the world health organization who around 2 billion people do not have access to essential medicines without effective treatments illnesses can be more severe and patients face worse health outcomes those with chronic conditions may spend years suffering while their health slowly deteriorates they are also more likely to face poverty and hunger creating a cycle of deprivation with 80 percent of countries accounting for just 20 percent of the world’s pharmaceutical consumption it is people in low- and middle-income countries lmics who are impacted most from this lack of access increasing access to healthcare remains one of the most prioritized yet complex global development challenges as reflected in the united nations’ sustainable development goal 3 living up to our vision of health for all means doing everything we can to ensure that any person that needs our products can obtain them our patient affordability programs make a big difference in helping patients with out-of-pocket cost they have the potential to change people’s access to medication significantly with the introduction of a more regional approach we intend to ignite the next level for access to sustainable healthcare’ florian noeske regional market access & access affairs providing access requires a broad range of interventions addressing the complex challenge of increasing patient access is no easy task so we are deploying a variety of strategies that address the diverse needs of patients in all parts of the world this ranges from in-kind donations of our products and intellectual resources to active contribution to global health networks we are also transforming our business by introducing flexible tailored approaches to reduce the burden of cost on patients by working to expand reimbursed access through our equitable pricing approach as well as dispensing more doses of our medicines per year through our patient affordability programs paps of course across all of these approaches we are collaborating with global and local ngos government agencies charities and other partners to ensure maximum impact collaborating and contributing where it’s needed most one straight-forward way we are making a difference is by making in-kind donations of medicines that would otherwise not make it to patients such as our products that treat neglected tropical diseases ntds endemic to some of the most impoverished and remote parts of the world or our treatments for rare conditions like hemophilia additionally as a leader in women’s health we’re empowering women globally by widening access to voluntary family planning – a key commitment in our sustainability agenda – through donations and reduced-cost access programs with partners in many instances donations are not enough or not sustainable in achieving our goal of consistent access in the long term through programs like the ghana heart initiative we collaborate with local partners to strenhen healthcare systems in lmics by supporting activities all along the stages of the value chain with a focus on patient access for other pressing health topics like antimicrobial resistance or the fight against covid-19 we play an active role in established global networks by contributing both financial and intellectual resources tackling affordability constraints with new equitable pricing approach when it comes to access to medicine we know cost can be a major barrier affordability can vary greatly across countries and regions we believe that this should be taken into consideration as we aim to deliver more access to our medicines to more patients worldwide that is why we are transforming the way we price our products our new pharmaceutical pricing philosophy amalgamates local ability-to-pay with product value to provide patients in need with our products our pricing philosophy takes into consideration local affordability and the value of the products to offer greater pricing flexibility to countries national health systems our pricing philosophy approach was initiated in 2020 and will continue to roll out worldwide in 2021 working to ensure treatment affordability for those who need it our tailored patient affordability programs paps help patients overcome financial obstacles to access the treatments they need for as long as they need them we work with insurers charities and others to make the financial impact on patients less severe while patients in different low-and-middle-income countries may face similar challenges in affording medicines each country will have different health care systems and ways of making treatments available our paps are created according to the local need of each country and can support patients by: assessing the individual’s ability to pay resulting in a customized approach where each individual will be required to pay only the amount one can afford during a 12-month period providing the required medication at reduced cost in the form of an immediate or deferred discount on the patient’s price or free-of-charge goods by building our paps on the specific needs of each country we have been able to make considerable progress in expanding access to our medicines with programs introduced across different geographies in multiple therapeutic areas we see the potential to reach an additional 150000 patients in the first three years with continued growth beyond our pricing philosophy is a really useful tool that helps country teams find ways for more people to benefit from our medicines if our negotiations are done in this spirit then our work with national counterparts is for a shared goal: to provide access to medicines to the widest possible population andriy skyrta manager business operations & strategy bayer pharmaceuticals measuring outcomes demonstrating impact we work closely with our partners to measure the outcomes and impact that our efforts have on increasing patients’ access to healthcare whether it is our work with the who and other organizations to eradicate ntds; our collaboration with the german agency

against the access targets we have set for our pricing philosophy and paps as part of this we will seek to monitor: the uptake of these approaches across low-and-middle-income countries lmics the

regions of the world by 2030 share: facebook twitter email linkedin ntds are preventable and treatable diseases that place a heavy burden on the world’s poorest populations in fact with over 17 billion people around the world afflicted – including more than a half a billion children – one in six people are infected with ntds worldwide on average and despite the huge amount of suffering these diseases inflict most people around the world are unaware of them ntds are widespread in poorer rural communities where most people live on less than two dollars per day these diseases impair physical and cognitive development contribute to mother and child illness and death make it difficult to farm or earn a living and limit productivity in the workplace as a result they trap the impoverished in a cycle of poverty and disease global ntd programs coordinated by the who in collaboration with private and public sector partners focus on identifying regions and countries where ntds are present and work to control or when possible eliminate them in line with our ‘health for all’ vision and ‘science for a better life’ purpose we have been collaborating with the who since 2002 in the fight against ntds in 2012 we signed the “london declaration on ntds” aimed at eliminating the 10 most devastating ntds by 2020 though significant progress has been made through public-private partnerships many of the targets have not yet been achieved therefore bayer has also signed the kigali declaration on ntds in 2022 bayer endorses the kigali declaration on neglected tropical diseases we focus on eliminating african sleeping sickness chagas disease as well as taeniasis we are committed to manufacturing and donating essential medicines as long as needed to achieve the goals set in the who ntd

agenda with opportunities to stimulate efforts through comprehensive approaches that require multisectoral collaboration the who ntd road map will be supported by the who sustainability framework for

in the fight against ntds addressing the many diseases that afflict the world’s poorest populations often in remote areas of the world is not an easy task it’s a challenge that must be addressed by multiple organizations and stakeholders both public and private that is why we partner with the who and other organizations to eliminate ntds through better understanding of disease burdens socio-cultural contexts and the varied obstacles to healthcare access we focus our efforts on the ntds where we can make the most impact based on our expertise portfolio of products and distribution networks as the only manufacturer of the treatments nifurtimox and suramin recognized by the who as essential medicines our initial focus has been on fighting the diseases these medicines treat like chagas disease and african sleeping sickness hat as part of this effort we have committed to continuing production and donation of these medicines as long as there is a need and to providing additional financial support for screening distribution education awareness and surveillance supporting the last stretch towards elimination of african sleeping sickness african sleeping sickness or human african trypanosomiasis hat is a deadly disease transmitted by the tsetse fly that threatens 57 million people in the rural communities of 36 sub-saharan countries african sleeping sickness can be fatal and has a long path of suffering as there is a high risk of handicap if not treated early while the who wide-scale intervention has led to a drop to less than one thousand reported cases in 2018 there are still cases that are not diagnosed and/or reported as a result of several factors including healthcare inaccessibility due to armed conflict in some of the most afflicted areas at bayer we’ve continued to donate treatments and resources toward the common goal of fully eradicating african sleeping sickness: since 2002 bayer has donated suramin for the treatment of hat rhodesiense since the launch of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy nect 2009 we have donated nifurtimox for the treatment of the most prevalent form of hat gambiense on behalf of the who médecins sans frontières doctors without borders is assembling patient treatment kits containing medicines as well as additional tools to facilitate treatments in even the most remote and resource-poor settings since 2016 bayer has provided additional financial support to fight african sleeping sickness in the country with the highest disease burden: the democratic republic of the congo the location of 95 percent of reported cases we support the work of mobile intervention teams for case finding and surveillance as well as awareness and education efforts and healthcare personnel hcp training interrupting the global spread of chagas disease chagas disease or american trypanosomiasis is named after the brazilian physician carlos chagas who discovered the disease in 1909 caused by the parasite trypanosoma cruzi it is most commonly spread through contact with the waste of a triatomine bug or “kissing bug” a blood-sucking insect the triatomine bug thrives in poorer housing conditions such as mud walls or thatched roofs thus mostly affecting the more impoverished in rural areas public health interventions particularly vector control have decreased the number of new infections and in some areas completely stopped transmission of the parasite by triatomine bugs however transmission through blood transfusions organ donation or from mother-to-child congenital can still occur if left untreated the disease can cause severe life-threatening organ damage years after the infection making early diagnosis and treatment essential to positive outcomes as a result of massive migration the disease has become a global threat to health systems in north america and europe with 6 to 7 million people worldwide estimated to be infected and over 75 million at risk of infection over the past 20 years we have been supporting the who in meeting an increasing annual demand of our product nifurtimox one of two medicines effective in treating chagas disease we also provide the who with financial support for logistics distribution awareness training of hcps and disease surveillance in endemic and non-endemic countries and are working to improve access to treatment in countries with the highest disease burdens in addition we developed nifurtimox for treatment of pediatric forms of the disease first approved in 2020 this new formulation significantly improves weight-adjusted dosing in children under 18 see our video series on chagas diseases to learn more championing new discoveries to treat river blindness onchocerciasis also known as river blindness is an infection caused by a parasitic worm spread by the repeated bite of a blackfly mostly found in rural agricultural areas in sub-saharan africa globally it is estimated that about 21 million people are infected and 205 million are at risk of infection which can cause skin depigmentation severe unrelenting itching and in the most serious cases blindness about 146 million people have the associated skin disease and over a million have lost their vision worldwide due to this parasite in 2014 bayer entered a product development partnership pdp with the drugs for neglected diseases initiative dndi to develop a new treatment option: emodepside current drugs only kill the parasite’s larvae and young worms leaving the adult worms alive and producing offspring since adult worms can live up to 15 years in the human body treatment must be given for up to 15 years emodepside now in phase ii of development is expected to kill the adult worms which could significantly shorten the duration of treatment and ultimately cure the disease taking on tapeworm the most common preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide taenia solium also called taeniasis/cysticercosis is an ntd belonging to the sub-group of neglected zoonoses diseases transmitted from animals to humans that are highly endemic in many countries of sub-saharan africa south-east asia and latin america the socioeconomic impact of untreated cysticercosis is immense as it affects the health and livelihood of subsistence farming communities by causing neurocysticercosis an infection of the central nervous system in humans reducing the market value of pigs and making pork unsafe to eat human infection with t solium occurs when people eat raw or undercooked infected pork risk factors often relate to poor sanitation including the lack of latrines unsafe water poor pig husbandry practices inadequate meat inspection and lack of knowledge about the parasite that causes it neurocysticercosis – a consequence of the t solium infection – results when parasite larvae embed and form cysts in the brain this type of infection is the cause of approximately 30 percent of all epilepsy cases in countries where it is endemic in 2019 we signed a five-year agreement to support whos global program combating taeniasis and neurocysticercosis in people exposed to or infected by the pork tapeworm t solium through this agreement we will help to expand access to essential medicines by donating praziquantel and niclosamide additionally we will provide funding to sustain control and prevention activities in pilot countries and help establish

bayer is working with the who and other partners to measure progress in our fight against ntds currently the who ntd roadmap 2030 seeks to encourage three fundamental shifts in the approach to tackling ntds: increased accountability for impact by using impact indicators instead of process indicators developing programmatic approaches that move away from siloed disease-specific programs towards cross-cutting perspectives centered around people and community needs establishing greater program ownership on behalf of countries monitoring and evaluation were noted as one of the four major gaps in the treatment of multiple diseases therefore in 2020 the who ntd working group on monitoring evaluation and research wg-mer was established to develop a framework for quantitative and

the united states of america canada many european and some western pacific countries how do people get chagas disease chagas disease is not transmitted from person-to-person but mainly through vector-borne transmission the insect vectors are called triatomine bugs after they bite and ingest blood they defecate on the person the person can become infected if trypanosoma cruzi parasites in the bug feces enter the body through mucous membranes or breaks in the skin the unsuspecting sleeping person may accidentally scratch or rub the feces into the bite wound eyes or mouth people also can

most prominent subsets of ncds are cardiovascular diseases cvds which are the number one cause of death globally between 1990 and 2013 sub-saharan africa was the only geographic region of the world where cvd deaths increased – the cvd burden in sub-saharan africa continues to rise and is projected to double by 2030 considering the severity of the impact of ncds it is therefore unsurprising that the world health organization has declared this growing health crisis a major obstacle to sustainable development and is working to reduce premature mortality from ncds including cvds by one third in 2030 to support this effort bayer joined 21 other pharmaceutical companies to found “access accelerated moving ncd care forward” an initiative aimed at improving access prevention and care for patients with ncds in low- and middle-income countries lmics at bayer we aim to enable broader patient access to our medicines and treatments worldwide to make our vision of “health for all hunger for

with the greater accra region and then hopefully we will be able to roll it out to other regions and then also to other parts of africa one of the key components of the ghi is training dr alfred doku consultant cardiologist in order for capacity-building projects such as the ghi to be effective we see a few criteria as being key: addressing local needs following a locally-driven needs assessment full local governance and buy-in a data-driven systematic approach with measurable output scalable interventions with defined outcomes an aim to sustainably strenhen the local system towards self-reliance for the ghi these criteria manifest themselves within four primary focus areas: establishing national guidelines: collaborating with the ministry of health to jointly develop national guidelines for risk assessment and management of cvds to direct healthcare professionals in shaping their practice furthermore these guidelines were used to develop training material enabling the capacity development of health service professionals and providers in each district thanks to the efforts of those involved these guidelines have already been created and approved and served as the foundation for a recently developed “facilitator’s guide” for cvd training strenhening health system capacity: training and providing resources to further instruct healthcare workers in the latest cvd risk assessment and management standards to enhance the capacity of health systems to meet the needs of patients we are helping with the implementation of a well-designed training approach to enable local governments to promote country-wide adoption blended learning approaches – including e-learning systems – can be used to scale-up the project to the entire country to date more than 650 health professionals have already been trained as part of this effort improving infrastructure: improving citizens’ access to cvd treatment through the procurement of essential equipment and monitoring of data the ghi has already begun to provide equipment for diagnosis and management of cvds in the participating health facilities creating a support center for cvd management: ensuring health professionals have access to professional medical support around the clock via a dedicated support center for cvd management in order to support health professionals at various levels in managing risk factors and preventing and managing complications the project also envisages a free telephone support service for health workers since the founding of the ghi we have already established a 24/7 support center for cvd management and have improved nation-wide data management ghi trailer the ghi aims to deliver clear outcomes in line with the un sustainable development goals 3 good health & well being and 17 partnerships for the goals following the successful implementation of the pilot phase in the greater accra region the ghi is now in its roll-out phase covering the entire country the precise targets of the ghi rollout in ghana are as follows: 1150 health professionals trained 55 expert trainers qualified 40 larger health facilities improved up to 80 low-level community-based health facilities improved equipment provided to participating health facilities e-learning module developed in our continued support of the ghi we will transparently share the impacts and outcomes of this initiative on this website the university of heidelberg has been contracted to evaluate the impact of the ghana heart initiative the university will capture the interventions implementation processes outcomes and costs by adopting an implementation science perspective the results of the evaluation study will support the effectiveness of the ghi interventions and help understand the overall impact of the ghi activities on the healthcare system in ghana it will also provide insights into areas for development and the cost of implementing this initiative in other regions the scientific study will contribute massively to the sustainability of prevention diagnosis and better management of cvds in sub-saharan africa we are happy to report that in march 2020 the ghi was able to donate medical equipment to 44 hospitals in the greater accra region towards the treatment of cardiovascular diseases cvds the equipment included defibrillators patient monitors weighing scales with height meters and glucometers kwaku agyemang-manu the minister of health spoke at the event as did the ghi project director dr alfred doku and the giz ghana country director regina bauerochse

collaboration in the fight against cancer: there is no “i” in cancer: how collaboration levels the cancer prevention and t… the latest innovations in cancer care are not accessible to all patients for a variety of reasons such as geography lack of infrastructure to deliver care delays in reimbursement for testing and treatment and lack of awareness this results in significant disparities in access to quality cancer care even within the same country some patients have access to optimal treatment and care whilst others do not lack of access to comprehensive testing and early optimal treatment can have a significant impact on the outcome of the therapy and thus on the life of the patients and their families we believe that every patient diagnosed with cancer should be able to access breakthrough innovations and medicines that are appropriate for them as an individual and can bring a meaningful difference to their lives improving access to quality cancer care in under-served communities as part of the oncology sustainability initiative at bayer we are working across the globe on projects that are primarily focused on improving access to quality cancer care for large

taking more control over your own personal health sounds easy but the reality can be much more complex standing in front of a store aisle with dozens of products trying to sift through endless information on the internet making sense of anecdotal stories from friends family and people on social media how is the average consumer supposed to know what to make of it all we believe strongly in the power of self-care to help people live healthier happier lives but confusing self-care — or worse ineffective self-care — can be worse than no self-care at all science-led self-care download our full report on the principles of science-led self-care pdf 35 mb at bayer science is at the core of all we do we call our approach to delivering safe effective products science-led self-care what this means is that every product is deeply rooted in science — from the early stages of medical research to safety assessments and finally to how to help people more effectively use them to do this we operate under a set of guiding principles for what a science-led self-care product should be and how our team should go about the process of innovating through these principles we hope to give people trust in the choices they are making and products they are using to take better care of their own health the five principles of science-led self-care we have five core principles that guide our science and innovation science of the human we are all different — that much is obvious — so self-care must not take a one-size fits all approach and we all have different unmet medical needs science-led self-care starts with focusing on people as individuals including their biology their microbiome and even their environments and developing products built for them science of regulation science-led self-care products are subject to regulation in the countries they are sold this is important to ensure products meet standards of safety and efficacy it can be hard to know who or what to trust but these regulatory approvals can give users assurance that someone has done the work for them science of discovery scientific knowledge is always expanding and that drive for new knowledge and understanding has launched amazing innovation for science-led self-care that means never stopping asking questions about the way things work and why they are how they are discovering new insights — including from unconventional places — helps us to keep advancing science-led self-care science of collaboration nobody has all the answers the best ideas and the best innovations happen when smart people with different strenhs join forces for a common good science-led self-care that prioritizes partnership and collaboration over individual achievement leads to better products science of consumer-product experience what good is a product that people can’t or don’t like using a bad experience can actually reduce people’s use of self-care and that isn’t good for anyone understanding how people can access self-care products and how they use them can lead to better experiences ultimately enabling them to take more control over their own health if you want to read more in-depth about

school support their families or spend time with their loved ones because they can’t prevent or treat everyday health ailments the nutrient gap initiative nearly 1 in 3 people globally don’t have access to essential vitamins and minerals which can lead to poor immunity fragile health stunted growth and other issues which preclude people from living a healthy life and breaking out of intergenerational cycles of poverty as leaders in nutritional supplements we understand the importance of proper micronutrient intake and the challenges of enabling access to them especially for those who need them most this is why we launched the nutrient gap initiative our signature program to expand access to vitamins and minerals into underserved communities we activate our scale adapt our portfolio and coordinate with partners to bridge the nutrient gap through: intervention: we bring vitamins and minerals within physical and financial reach education: we empower healthcare providers and people in underserved communities with the information they need to understand nutrition a balanced diet and the role supplementation plays if needed advocacy: we use our scale and partnerships to advocate for access to good nutrition through the nutrient gap initiative we aim to reach 50 million people annually by 2030 environmental sustainability we’ve set a goal to become climate neutral at our production sites by 2030 and at the same time decrease the environmental impact of our products to meet this goal we’re lowering emissions across our value chain as part of our science-based targets and developing more eco-friendly packaging climate neutrality we have established a roadmap to meet climate neutrality across our production sites scope 1 and 2 emissions for example we have already implemented renewable energy at three key production facilities that serve the consumer health division of bayer — alcala spain and darmstadt germany in europe and guatemala city in latin america at alcala this effort helped reduce the site’s absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 75% from 2019 to 2020 we are also engaging with our suppliers and partners to reduce our scope 3 emissions across our value chain environmental impact human health and the health of our planet are inextricably linked scientific data has made clear that climate change is one of the biggest global health threats of our time which is why bayer is committed to providing personal health solutions for people around the world in ways that protect our planet as part of our ongoing effort to create a healthier world we are investing €100 million to improve how our consumer health products are made and consumed through this investment we’re able to accelerate the implementation of bayer’s ambitious 2030 sustainability commitments with a three-pronged science-based action plan in which we are: 1 prioritizing sustainable brands products and packaging this includes transforming 100% of bayer’s consumer health packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 2 turbocharging our commitment to carbon neutrality by taking specific and strategic actions to increase energy efficiency and go renewable across our entire value chain 3 urging collective action with others to drive sustained change including helping to develop and sign the global self-care federation’s environmental charter

especially while internet shopping or traveling find out more… share: facebook twitter email linkedin counterfeits exist of products made by nearly all renowned pharmaceutical companies bayer too is affected through its drug for treatment of erectile dysfunction criminals make counterfeits of other medicines as well and sell them primarily through illegal online pharmacies but there is clear evidence that they are sold in red-light districts discos and gyms please remember: even if an illegal medication seems to work you never know what substances you are in fact taking – nor what risks they have and side effects they may cause how do i protect myself from counterfeits knowledge protects you from fakes if you want to protect yourself be suspicious of dubious offers the most important question is: do i trust the seller when in doubt check this website for a list of reputable internet pharmacies if a private person tries to sell you medications decline the offer and immediately contact the police or customs authorities in europe medications may only be sold through pharmacies most medicines are available only with a prescription pharmacists may only provide medication when the patient provides a prescription from a physician you can find out which medication require a prescription by looking at the package or asking your pharmacist in matters of prescription medicine view your pharmacy as your trusted partner new levitra® counterfeit: packs and / or blisters with the batch number bxb10855 are always fakes example: drugs for treating erectile dysfunction many fake drugs for erectile dysfunction are sold illegally and sometimes even at a higher price than the original product a pharmacy is the only trustworthy place for prescription medicines anyone who ignores pharmaceutical legislation is only interested in their own profit and not in providing safe effective high-quality medicines tips: you always need a prescription to get prescription medicine other offers are illegal it is also illegal to sell medication without the full packaging in europe consisting of a foldable box blister and patient medication guides leaflet illegal online pharmacies often sell counterfeited tablets with packaging that is nearly identical to the original these packages resemble the original product very closely but commonly contain spelling mistakes levitra® packagings

purchasing medication abroad go to the pharmacy in that country rather than other sources it makes sense to speak with your physician or pharmacist and prepare a personal “travel kit” containing your medicines before you go abroad should suspicious medication fall in your hands consult your physician or pharmacist or contact the original product’s maker this is particularly true if you notice that a medicine you have taken seems to have a different effect than usual or if the packaging somehow seems different the european commission has developed a verification logo to prevent fakes from being sold in europe only certified online pharmacies are allowed to display the new logo – a white cross on green-and-gray background – on their home pages a click on the logo takes consumers to the website of the public authority in their country where they find a list of all certified pharmaceutical distributors consumers can be confident that vendors with the verification logo sell only original brands more information about the verification logo can be found in this article european parallel imports please note that in certain cases so-called parallel imports are allowed in the eu importers may import authorized medications from another country of the european union and repackage them they exchange the original packaging for their own version or attach labels in the country’s

at worst they can be harmful or even fatal the number of unreported falsifications is high there are no precise figures on counterfeited drugs but the number of unreported cases is high estimates suggest that about every second product sold on the internet could be falsified most of the fake medicines are produced in countries with poor law enforcement the world health organization who believes that counterfeited drugs are made especially in africa asia and south america since dubious online suppliers deliver worldwide the products also find their way to germany the european commission has developed a verification logo to prevent the dangerous fakes from being sold in europe only certified online pharmacies are allowed to display the new logo – a white cross on green-and-gray background – on their home pages a click on the logo takes consumers to the website of the responsible authority in their country where they find a list of all certified drug distributors consumers can be confident that vendors with the verification logo only sell original brands the new eu logo protects consumers the new verification logo is to be introduced at the end of july it enables customers to check the sellers reputability with little effort the european commission warns against buying from online pharmacies that are not on the list eu member states have one year starting from july to certify the corresponding online pharmacies the lists of all the eu member states are to be accessible at all times from the home page of the european medicines agency ema however patients can already protect themselves against fraud today for example prescription products may only be sold against a valid prescription in germany if someone offers a prescription drug for sale without a prescription that is an illegal offer internet fraudsters often offer drugs without any packaging or in the wrong pack however it is illegal to sell medicines without the complete packaging the packaging consists of the carton the blister and the information leaflet in both cases patients should not buy the products but report the dealer to the authorities if a suspicious drug is purchased despite all precautions it should be shown to a physician or pharmacist especially if the drug once taken has different effects or if the packaging does not look right bayer is committed worldwide to the fight against fake drugs to further reduce drug falsification bayer is actively involved in the fight against falsifiers its beware of counterfeits campaign aims to protect customers from illegal offers bayer warns explicitly against counterfeited products on sale in the internet the company examines specific incidents in close coordination with the authorities and secures the relevant evidence bayer operates according to the zero-tolerance principle if one or more offenders are identified the company passes on all the available information to the public prosecutors office to bring the people to justice furthermore bayer informs patients by running awareness campaigns and printing brochures on how to distinguish genuine medicines from counterfeited products if a customer remains uncertain about the reputability of an online trader bayer recommends they purchase the drug concerned in a local pharmacy or confer with their physician bayer intends to use technical means to further improve the protection of its own products against falsification – for example to make it easier for the patient to distinguish between the original and a fake more information about counterfeit drugs find here the european commission‘s press release external videos counterfeits: how to protect yourself what are counterfeits links research at bayer products from a to z product stewardship follow us

effect medical counterfeits recognizing fakes eu verification logo against counterfeit drugs background information recognizing fraudulent brands links new safety features for prescription medicine in europe commitment to fighting counterfeit drugs you can find answers to the following questions share: facebook twitter email linkedin counterfeiting medication is very profitable for criminals they take advantage of the good reputation of products and brands that the original manufacturer established through its consistently high-quality products fraudsters are only interested in producing what looks like an exact copy and do not care about the quality and effectiveness of the contents in many countries the risk of getting caught and punished for selling fake medicines is relatively low so counterfeiting medication can be more lucrative than selling illegal drugs however the structures are comparable to those in organized crime do you have questions here you will find answers as well as information on counterfeit medicines: who is affected by counterfeit drugs what are counterfeits are substandard products comparable to counterfeited drugs what are the health risks the problem on a global scale organizations associations authorities who is affected by counterfeit drugs anything that makes money will be counterfeited this affects patented medications as well as generics expensive prescription drugs such as those used in aids or cancer therapy are especially lucrative for dubious businesses antibiotics are the most commonly counterfeited drugs particularly in low-income nations where medicines are prohibitively expensive for many people in high-income countries there is a growing trend toward fake “lifestyle” medications for treating erectile dysfunction theoretically every patient is at risk even though there might be differences at the national level patients should be cautious about buying drugs on the internet or when purchasing medications abroad what are counterfeits the world health organization who and the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers & associations ifpma describe counterfeits as drugs that have been falsely labeled regarding their identity and/or origin to deliberately fool consumers basically counterfeits are drugs that do not come from or are not offered in the same form as medicines from the original manufacturer exempted from this are changes that have been properly and lawfully made as in the case of parallel imports counterfeits range from complete fakes that have been made by a counterfeiter to original products with manipulated expiration dates examples of counterfeited drugs are medications that contain the correct active agent however either at a dosage that is too high or too low have manipulated expiration dates possess no active agents contain an active agent other than the one specified or are wrapped in forged packaging blisters and/or contain falsified patient information unfortunately patients doctors or pharmacists may not be able to distinguish such “medications” from the real ones without a very detailed inspection if consumers are suspicious they should contact their doctor pharmacist or the original manufacturer counterfeited generic medicine authentic generics are credible medications however criminal organizations increasingly offer products that are supposedly equivalent to certain original generic products or to their active ingredients to prevent misunderstandings: “generics” are reputable medicines produced after the original brand-name product has lost its patent protection generics are available under a different name yet offer equivalent quality to brand name products generics manufacturers can also be victims of counterfeiters here too the most important rule is: prescription medicines may not be distributed without a prescription any person or company who offers prescription medicines and claims these are similar to an original product is possibly offering fake drugs please consult your physician pharmacist or original manufacturer when confronted with dubious offers what are the health risks medicines are used to treat diseases and to promote health that is not important to counterfeiters they are not interested in providing patients with a medicine that is equivalent to the original product even if a fake drug contains certain active ingredients these medicines have a lower quality or quantity of the substance this can cause a vaccination or test result to fail for example or can even lead to pathogens becoming resistant to the original active substance legislators have established an elaborate procedure to clinically examine approve and follow-up medicines for a reason in extreme cases counterfeiters add dangerous or even toxic substances to their products to achieve the same “effect” more precisely a side effect not a true medicinal property as seen with the original medicine to simulate authenticity ultimately patients need reliable easy-to- understand information about the indication use and dosage of their medicines this is why prescriptions are required – to protect patients from considerable dangers and potential damages of a drug the prescribing physician and / or pharmacist explains the application the correct dosage and possible side effects of the medicine to the patient anyone who provides prescription medication without a prescription bypasses this secure consultation for the patient certain medical products may be sold only in pharmacies although these are not prescription medicines only pharmaceutically-trained personnel may dispense them to consumers patients should not blindly trust internet offers for such products the problem on a global scale illegal trade takes place around the world the world health organization who estimates that counterfeit medicines worth 73 billion euros are traded annually dubious online pharmacies that conceal their true location deliver globally – reaching countries such as germany uk italy spain etc or the usa supplies from illegal internet pharmacies – those without appropriate certification – are up to 50 percent counterfeits the extent of the problem varies greatly between regions and individual countries and also depends largely on temporary supplies the problem is highly dependent on how tight legal controls are the who estimates that in some areas in africa asia and south america more than 30 percent of medicines in circulation are fakes in some countries of eastern europe the proportion of fake medicines can be more than 20 percent in europe and in the usa as well as in other developed countries less than one percent of the medications sold are counterfeits despite this the trend shows that counterfeits in our globalized world are no longer just a problem of developing countries when traveling patients often purchase their medicines abroad and in some cases bring them home for family members and friends even though it is prohibited to do so typical market structures and trading routes have been liberalized allowing vendors to sell medicines at lower prices and last but not least the internet has made sales and trade of various articles simpler and more global organizations associations authorities international cooperation is needed as counterfeits are a global problem that only can be solved through cross-border actions every country and every company must also take responsibility to protect consumers and patients it is essential to relentlessly uncover fraud and effectively prosecute counterfeiters in the coming years it will be important to establish national and international structures and networks as well as create suitable legal guidelines furthermore it is necessary to raise awareness in the relevant institutions and authorities as is already largely the case with customs authorities share: facebook twitter email linkedin

recognize fake drugs share: facebook twitter email linkedin they look like the real deal the product name rings a bell the logo of a well-known pharmaceutical company is visibly printed on the label however appearances are deceiving in reality these packages are often manufactured by criminal organizations that want to make a profit at the expense of the patients’ health they create fraudulent brands to make their fake drugs look like real ones neither the quality nor efficacy of these supposed medicines is guaranteed example: testosterone products 1/2 2/2 previous next for certain medical conditions such as impotence or bone loss patients benefit from a therapy with testosterone bodybuilders use testosterone as a doping agent to accelerate muscle growth and to boost their performance so-called “anabolic agents” because users seldom have a prescription they buy the product through dubious channels this is extremely risky “medicines” that are available from illegal pharmacies or in the darknet are rarely tested or licensed bayer has observed that not only fake versions of their products are being sold but increasingly “bogus” medicines are being offered that have never been produced by the company or any other real pharmaceutical manufacturer taking testosterone incorrectly can lead to serious side effects these range from cardiovascular disease to liver cancer how do i protect myself from counterfeit drugs if you are not familiar with a medicine play it safe make sure the drug is actually manufactured by the company named on the label a quick search on drugscom can provide a first clue on whether to trust this medicine or not you can also ask the manufacturer whether it produces this medication be wary if acquaintances whether online or in person recommend certain medicines or offer to sell these to you certain drugs are not available over the counter for a reason buying such medications on your own could make you liable to penalties and taking such drugs could potentially cause serious health damage how do i recognize fake medications real medicines must go through strict control processes before they are approved manufacturers must prove the product’s efficacy in several studies of course scammers using brand names or company logos fraudulently do not adhere to these procedures be especially careful of the following: low prices fake brands or bogus medicines do not undergo development or tests lasting several years scammers sell their products for prices that seem too good to be true and usually focus on this aspect in their advertisements fake bayer cross be wary of products that depict the bayer cross in a distorted form or with unusual color patterns compare the labels with bayer products that you know familiar-sounding product names some scammers invent names for their products that closely resemble the products you know and trust by entering these names in a search engine you will quickly find out whether a manufacturer actually makes the drug herbal extracts that are supposedly free from side effects natural ingredients can also cause side effects if a manufacturer claims that their product is especially safe and potent it is probably a “bogus” product worst case it contains a dangerous cocktail of active agents share: facebook twitter email linkedin contact report suspicious drug

stakeholders it is difficult to decide whether a company can be seen or classified as “sustainable” for decades the so called esg rating agencies have been focusing on exactly this question: using comprehensive and proprietary methodologies esg rating agencies assess multiple indicators especially on environmental social and governance topics esg and measure a company’s respective risk exposure as well as the performance on how these esg risks are being managed the methodologies used by the esg rating agencies differ in particular with regard to which esg topics are considered to be material for the assessment the results published by these esg rating agencies are commonly referred to as “esg ratings” listed companies like bayer are assessed by multiple esg rating agencies - often publishing heterogenous results the basis for the esg rating agencies’ assessments is bayer’s sustainability report which is published annually we constantly screen the requirements from esg rating agencies and aim to provide the respective data and information as part of our comprehensive reporting which undergoes auditor’s assurance before being published through this increased transparency on esg topics and through targeted and constructive dialogue we have made significant progress in recent years with what we consider to be the most important esg rating agencies and esg rankings this includes clearing the red flags from msci esg research in 2022 and from iss-esg in 2021 as well as improved esg ratings from all relevant issuers in addition an outstanding scoring from ecovadis

agencies mainly analyze publicly available data and information on a company as well as external assessments and in many cases also a collection of press articles mentioning the company understanding the relevance of esg ratings for our stakeholders bayer has been maintaining a close collaboration with leading esg rating agencies for years aiming to achieve a fair and transparent esg assessment of our company’s efforts – not only regarding our sustainability activities while doing so we also gain comprehensive feedback from the stakeholder group of esg rating agencies and learn about their view on sustainability and their expectations of companies like bayer bayer’s sustainability indices and other ratings besides the global and common esg rating agencies’ surveys many other inquiries on sustainability issues are performed which are equally important as they take a deeper look into divisional and functional areas and their esg performance they do not provide a dedicated “esg scoring”

requirements in each case read more about it in our sustainability report climate protection climate change affects us all and is one of the greatest challenges that humankind will face in the future bayer considers climate protection and the related reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be a top priority we anticipate that our business areas of health care and agriculture will be impacted by climate change but will also be part of the solution discover more about our climate targets in our sustainability report chapter 7 bayer supports the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures tcfd with respect to reporting on this topic in our report we implement the 11 recommendations of the tcfd in the four categories of governance strategy risk management and metrics & targets for more information please see our separate tcfd report energy our energy needs have the greatest direct impact on our greenhouse gas emissions production accounts for the most significant share of our energy requirement which depends on the production operations at the sites and the depth of our value chain among the targets we have set within the context of our climate strategy is to cover 100% of purchased electricity needs with renewable energies by 2030 to achieve this objective we have produced a catalogue of criteria such as physical proximity to the production plant and additionality in 2021 around 247% of our purchased electricity was sourced from renewable energies we concluded additional supply agreements for electricity from renewable energies in the united states brazil and germany in 2021 we are thus on track to achieve our target of 100% in 2029 compared with 2020 359 petajoules bayer’s total energy consumption fell by 29% to 348 petajoules in 2021 this includes both primary energy consumption mainly of fossil fuels and secondary energy consumption this decline compared to 2020 is primarily due to interruptions in pro-duction as a result of hurricane ida at the sites in soda springs idaho and luling louisiana in the united states a reduction in the number of vehicles in the company fleet also contributed energy management systems such as iso 50001 also help to identify potential energy savings in production processes as well as when developing new production processes and converting exist-ing ones this not only conserves valuable energy resources but also takes into account economic factors associated with long-term savings in our report to cdp we also describe projects to save energy that were implemented at various sites discover more about our climate commitments greenhouse gas emissions at bayer air emissions are primarily caused by the combustion of primary energy sources such as gas and oil these are used to generate electricity steam and auxiliary energy such as for heating and cooling for the manufacture of our products further emissions derive from chemical processes in which coal and other energy sources are required to produce chemical reactions emissions are also generated by our vehicle fleet and in the extraction and processing of raw materials in reporting greenhouse gas emissions we take into ac-count the recommendations of the greenhouse gas protocol ghg protocol direct emissions from our own power plants vehicles waste incineration plants and production facilities scope 1 and indirect emissions from the procurement of electricity steam and cooling energy scope 2 are determined at all environmentally relevant sites whose annual consumption exceeds 15 terajoules in this connection we have drafted group regulations for the group-wide recording of greenhouse gas emissions in line with the ghg protocol we report indirect emissions scope 2 according to both the location-based and market-based methods bayer’s greenhouse gas emissions fell further in 2021 com-pared to 2020 we succeeded in reducing our own scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 115% or around 410000 metric tons particularly by increasing the share of our electricity derived from renewable energies overall we have already reduced our own emissions scope 1 and scope 2 by 157% compared with the reference year 2019 discover more in our sustainability report chapter 74 we address our climate protection activities in our latest report to cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project video: surviving water scarcity water and wastewater responsible water usage is a cornerstone of our commitment to sustainable development and is described in the group regulation on hse management and hse key requirements clean water in sufficient quantities is essential for the health of people animals and plants that is why it is crucial that industrial water usage will continue not to lead to local problems such as water shortages for the people living in the catchment areas of our production sites in our water position we undertake to comply with international national and local legislation to protect water resources use them as sparingly as possible and further reduce emissions into water in our water stewardship strategy we address a variety of factors connected with water from operational water use and innovative products such as drought-resistant crops with a reduced water requirement to our commitment in the value chain and cooperation with partners we support the ceo water mandate of the un global compact with the goal of working with key stakeholders to develop sustainable strategies for water usage since 2021 furthermore we have been a member of the water resilience coalition wrc the goals of which substantiate and supplement the ambitions of the ceo water mandate at the private-sector level we also participate in the water and climate leaders group of the world meteorological organization wmo to improve the global political framework and enhance the perceived relevance of this issue among the public we are currently further developing our water strategy to better address the opportunities and risks associated with water stewardship in the future especially in view of changing climatic conditions discover more in our sustainability report chapter 83 in our annual response to the cdp water disclosure we report in detail on our handling of water and the company-specific water footprint this equates to a progress report for the ceo water mandate we received an a-rating in 2021 packaging bayer‘s products and services are designed to help people thrive within the planetary boundaries we want to contribute to decrease the environmental footprint within our operations and our value chain to accomplish this ambition we are advancing our sustainable packaging activities key actions are reducing designing for recycling recollecting and reusing / usage of recycling material and responsible sourcing we are aligned with the circular economy principles of minimize waste and pollution recirculate circulate products and materials – at their highest value regenerate reduce emissions and regenerate natural systems and partnerships collaboration across the value chain the agricultural pharmaceutical as well as the self-care sector are highly regulated operating effectively within an evidence-based framework to maintain the highest standards bayer uses a variety of materials for its product packaging with the most common being paper and plastic within our area of influence we seek to address sustainable packaging along the value chain sustainable packaging should offer maximum functionality with the best possible product protection avoiding health and safety risks cause minimal ecological impact and be as circular as possible we support regulatory frameworks and policy initiatives that promote and incentivize innovative sustainable packaging technologies processes and business models digitalization strenhens industry competitiveness and reflects evolving market conditions our divisions contribute to sustainable packaging in various ways: consumer health the consumer health division is implementing an approach emphasizing recycling reducing being responsible and replacing and has set the following targets by / for 2030: a 100% of bayer consumer health’s packaging will be recycle-ready or reusable b all packaging will include consumer-friendly recycling information c include an average of 50% recycled content and d 100% of purchased paper will be sustainably sourced the division also signed the global self-care federation’s environmental sustainability charter to encourage industry-wide progress on the most material environmental challenges of the self-care industry including sustainable packaging further information can be found here pharmaceuticals our pharmaceutical business with prescription medication operates in a strictly regulated environment packaging is strictly oriented toward functional requirements has unique challenges and a lower reduction potential pharmaceuticals works continuously to reduce the ecological footprint in packaging and production a great achievement incorporating circular principles was the new packaging design of our radioactive product xofigo where we are saving 38t of lead per year while keeping the packaging safe for patients and the environment further information on our activities within pharmaceuticals can be found here crop science due to the chemical composition of our crop protection products the crop science product supply team must ensure the compliance of our packaging with the un regulations for dangerous goods transportation beyond these boundaries we are constantly striving to enhance sustainability of our chemical and seeds packaging in terms of weight reduction use of recycled materials as well as design for recyclability as an example related to product stewardship and enhanced producer responsibility the bayer crop science team has been focusing on ensuring that used containers are properly emptied rinsed and dispose bayer supports programs worldwide to foster the safe recollection and disposal or - even better - recycling of empty packaging and containers users can learn about product container disposal opportunities through information on our labels and/or material safety data sheets in collaboration with the industry association croplife international bayer supports the establishment of container management systems for used crop protection containers particularly in countries without suitable collection or disposal programs for example in asia africa and some latin american countries under coordination of croplife international the crop protection industry could achieve a global collection of 800000 metric tons of plastic packaging since 2005 further information at crop science

environmental requirements remain high and applied worldwide read more here bayer compensates employees on both permanent and temporary employment contracts in excess of the statutory minimum wage in the respective countries paying a living wage that is annually reviewed and specified worldwide by the nonprofit organization business for social responsibility bsr that makes bayer one of the first companies to commit globally to this concept this also applies to part-time employees whose compensation was proportionately aligned with that of a full-time position environmental protection and

are safe for people animals and the environment when properly used we have put in place suitable directives and management systems to meet our product stewardship responsibility in regard to human rights for more information click here respect for human rights in the supply chain in regard to the topic of human rights we are focusing especially on our supply chain because this connects us with several million rightsholders – in other words people who are directly or indirectly impacted by our activities we report in more detail in chapter 53 of our sustainability report or here we continually work with our suppliers and expect them to fully observe and respect human rights in their operations our expectations are demonstrated through our supplier code of conduct the supplier code of conduct is based on our human rights policy the principles of the un global compact and the core labor standards of the ilo it includes child labor forced labor and any other form of modern slavery freedom of association working time and wages harassment & discrimination use of security forces challenges in seed supply chain the risk of human rights violations poses a particular challenge for bayer in the seed supply chain in 2022 we began to deal in detail with human rights risks along our global seed supply chain and to improve our risk prevention and mitigation measures one particular focus is on child labor combating child labor our position on child labor is clear – it is not tolerated at bayer we therefore obligate our suppliers to refrain from employing children through our child care program bayer has for years taken systematic action to prevent child labor in the seed supply chain the program is established in india bangladesh and the philippines – the countries in which we identified the risk of child labor infractions through our child care program we raise awareness about this problem among our suppliers and clearly communicate our requirements it involves systematic and repeated inspections of individual seed producers in their fields by local bayer employees during the growing season in 2021/22 we did not identify any cases of child labor in india bangladesh or the philippines we report in more detail in chapter 53 of our sustainability report challenges in the raw materials extraction risks of human rights violations are often associated with extraction of raw materials as the procurement of minerals originating from unstable regions of the world can contribute to the financing of conflicts and the violation of human rights we work to ensure that so-called conflict materials are procured responsibly as such additional verification processes were established for the fulfillment of further international regulations such as those requesting companies to disclose the origin of certain raw materials the explicit expectations of our suppliers are spelled out in our supplier code of conduct suppliers who do not meet these requirements are immediately notified that these standards must be complied with and suitable measures initiated bayer’s net-zero deforestation as well as the human rights commitment along the value chain includes the ambition to source sustainable palm kernel oil and soy derivatives bayer believes in sustainable value chains with the focus on sustainable production transparency traceability and certification our activities are aligned with the elements of the accountability framework we collaborate with our partners and suppliers to further decrease our environmental footprint and set social and ethical standards find further details on the programs of conflict minerals as well as sustainable palm sustainable soy other plant-based materials here on the topic of human rights we engage in dialogue with external stakeholders and actively participate in committees and initiatives established to ensure the observance of human rights stakeholder engagement we engage in the relevant working groups of econsense where we assumed sponsorship of the issue of business and human rights in 2022 the business for social responsibility bsr initiative and in the supply chain via our industry initiatives together for sustainability tfs and the pharmaceutical supply chain initiative psci the member companies from various industries discuss best practices challenges and experiences in implementing the ungps in a specialist group established in 2022 under the auspices of the chemie³ initiative furthermore we participate in the development of an industry standard for sustainable value creation for the chemical and pharmaceutical sector that is designed to help companies implement human rights due diligence at the pre-summit of the un food systems summit we joined the coalition of action on living incomes and decent work and are supporting this initiative continuously raising awareness about human rights the agriculture sector requires extensive measures and the involvement of various stakeholders against this background bayer joined with other seed companies back in 2019 to establish the enabling child and human rights with seed organizations echo initiative

restoration of biodiversity in agriculture and forestry at a glance key threats to biodiversity include land use change including the loss degradation and fragmentation of cropland habitats; deforestation; urbanization; invasive alien species and a lack of knowledge and awareness of biodiversity broadly bayer is committed to conserving and restoring biodiversity within and beyond agricultural fields through our technologies and services in addition to our current approaches and business models we need to find creative ways and new partnerships to better address the nexus between climate change and nature degradation and the need to improve food security our actions are based on principles which are reflected in our biodiversity strategy: developing innovative sustainable solutions supporting farmers & landowners advancing the science in balancing food production while enhancing biodiversity helping to protect forests & promoting sustainable vegetation management helping to mitigate climate change we intend to support farmers further integrate crop production and biodiversity conservation while making cropping systems more resilient to climate change over scale and time by building synergies and protecting forests and other natural habitats background biodiversity is under threat according to the latest ipbes1 report on biodiversity and ecosystem services more than 1 million species face extinction driven by human activity in agriculture the most important drivers for the loss of biodiversity are land use change climate change crop management practices and pollution2 agriculture relies on biodiversity: many species create and maintain important ecosystem services like healthy soils pollination or pest control and are thus essential for food feed and fibre production maintaining a diverse range of species allows agricultural systems to be more resilient to stresses including those caused by climate change at the same time the very purpose of agriculture is to provide a safe and secure food supply for humans which entails the sensible use of measures to protect those crops from organisms that could compromise the harvest obtaining the optimal balance is our goal our view the diversity of ecosystems species and crop varieties is inherently valuable and needs to be protected we acknowledge that farming like many other activities has an impact on biodiversity to meet the social environmental and economic needs of a population that is growing in numbers and wealth we need to further optimize agricultural production systems we can build on existing technologies and solutions which have already significantly reduced the impact on the environment mainly through tremendous increases in productivity and efficiency we believe that only through diversity in farming systems can we equally conserve biodiversity and provide important other needs we are committed to conserving and restoring biodiversity within and beyond agricultural fields through our technologies and services we follow the united nations’ “convention on biological diversity cbd” and are also committed to its objectives including the conservation of biological diversity the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and traditional knowledge it is our priority to facilitate the adoption of biodiversity conservation measures by farmers and landowners as an integral part of good agricultural practices therefore we will invest in the development of innovative tools and services that improve farming and land management practices while balancing production and conservation objectives however there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution acknowledging the global diversity of cropping systems regulatory requirements and societal expectation we will collaborate with local experts and associations to develop tailored tools that can address the challenges of each field what we will do: innovative sustainable solutions we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of crop protection by 30 % within our area of influence by investing more than anybody else in this industry to: develop a new generation of crop protection solutions with improved properties in terms of biodegradability and selectivity that can replace older less environmentally friendly chemicals push and advance the use of integrated crop management and precision application technology allowing farmers to use crop protection products in a more targeted way applying them only when and where needed create innovative new biotech crops new formulation technologies and seed coatings that lead to significantly reduced application volumes additionally our innovations in breeding and digital farming will increase the nitrogen use efficiency of crops which reduces nitrate run-off and leaching- one major cause of eutrophication and acidification by leveraging our global scale we contribute to a broad adoption of these modern more sustainable solutions supporting farmers & landowners we will provide continuous collaborative support to farmers co-designing sustainable farming practices stewardship activities and training programs such as baygap or better life farming for smallholder farmers we will enable farmers and landowners to participate in initiatives that improve local biodiversity by supporting them in creating natural or semi-natural habitats within and beyond their cropped fields as part of broader landscape planning to conserve associated biodiversity and endangered species we already provide access to relevant advice incentives or networks to increase attractiveness for farmers to participate in those programs additional work and data are needed to identify strong synergies between biodiversity-enabling measures and farmer engagement however we strongly believe that conserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services is a value that farmers can generate for society it is our long-term ambition to identify the best incentivizing models for farmer engagement & biodiversity friendly practices we will strive to reduce agriculture-related biodiversity loss while bringing commercial value to farmers and landowners who join our efforts in protecting biodiversity advance the science in balancing food production while enhancing biodiversity we will continue our scientific research to better understand the root causes of insect decline and to develop adequate countermeasures that are practical for farmers to implement and which can have benefits for both biodiversity and farming our research collaborations on pollinator management already show promising results we advocate for science-based policies and innovations that achieve a balanced outcome helping to protect forests and promoting sustainable vegetation management in cooperation with farmers and external partners we will engage in programs focused on reforestation and avoiding deforestation we will provide landowners with solutions to control invasive alien species through vegetation management activities that support the re-settlement of native species and the restoration of diversified habitats we aim for net-zero deforestation in our supply chain by 2021 – and will encourage our licensees to do the same helping to mitigate climate change we also recognize climate change as an impacting factor on biodiversity which requires further research and deeper understanding as a company we have a clear goal to reduce field greenhouse gas emissions in the most emitting cropping systems that bayer serves by 30% by 2030 in addition we will reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 we will strenhen the synergies between biodiversity and climate change mitigation soil health and soil biodiversity play a key role in this context as soil health and biodiversity enhancing measures such as cover crops crop rotations or field margin habitats can lead to significant soil carbon sequestration soils rich in organic matter increase farmers’ resilience towards negative effects of climate change droughts erosive precipitationwe will work to find creative ways to revise business models and establish new partnerships to better

promotion of new talent bayer 04 leverkusen culture position on deforestation and forest degradation background forests play a vital role in mitigating climate change fostering biodiversity and enabling water and soil conservation millions of people rely on forests for food security livelihoods and energy sources while the rate of forest loss and degradation has slowed globally since 2000 they still contribute to challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss deforestation and forest degradation are complex with multiple causes that differ from region to region but agriculture has historically been among the major drivers overall deforestation is driven by the need to provide food feed energy timber and housing for a global population steadily growing in numbers and wealth to meet this growing demand without increasing the pressure for deforestation yield gaps need to be closed around the globe through the adoption of modern agriculture and forestry technologies and practices fulfilling the demand in one region should not occur at the cost of deforestation in another region bayer’s position within our area of influence including working with our farmer customers and within our supply chain we seek to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation we want to make a significant contribution not only to protecting existing forests but also helping to restore lost forest land we do not have all the solutions to challenges as big as deforestation however we continuously expand our collaborations with relevant local and regional organizations that complement our technologies with their knowledge and networks we also participate in coalitions across the value chain with the objective to achieve net zero deforestation we want to make a significant contribution not only to protecting existing forests but also helping to restore lost forest land bayer’s contribution agriculture innovations can help reduce the need to expand crop production areas into natural habitats such as woodlands and forests innovation in seed varieties crop protection products and digital farming solutions combined with stewardship measures and training on responsible use enable farmers and forest farmers to achieve higher yielding crops and forest plantations on existing land these innovations can do this with lower inputs of land water energy or crop protection resources consistent with bayer’s commitments to reduce by 30% the environmental impact of crop protection and greenhouse gas emissions on our customers’ fields by 2030 bayer has committed to help 100 million smallholder farmers increase their livelihood in farming we believe that the increase in productivity will decrease the need to convert forest into agricultural land or to find additional income in forest exploitation bayer is currently implementing programs for vegetation management and afforestation implementing native species afforestation programs and including the use of herbicides to control invasive grass species has been found to provide a 3 times greater above ground biomass and improved species richness compared to less intensive spontaneous regeneration methods brancalion et al 2019 thanks to well selected native seedlings and modern agronomic technology through digital farming technologies bayer is looking into ways of supporting and incentivizing farmers to protect existing forests and natural habitats on their land by helping them to better evaluate the benefits of preserving habitats and forests versus farming marginal or less-productive land bayer aims for net-zero deforestation in our supply chain – and will encourage our licensees to do the same as the most prominent example we will ensure 100% compliance with the brazilian forest code in our production fields we are committed to using bayer’s expertise and technologies to support brazil’s goal of restoring 12 million hectares of native forest by 2030 bayer is committed to become carbon neutral in its own operations by 2030 to accomplish this we will offset part of our emissions through investments in reforestation projects bayer shares the value of international cooperation to promote viable measures in sustainable development and environmental protection this is why we support forest protection instruments in trade agreements as long as they are science-based equitable and safeguard an open and non-discriminatory trading system sustainability is core to how we do business at bayer we apply the same rigor to setting and measuring our

& social innovation science education culture of remembrance bayer clubs sports bayer and sports successful bayer athletes history disabled sports promotion of new talent bayer 04 leverkusen culture relevant positions our views on insect decline at a glance the decline of insects which is currently being observed by scientists is causing concern to many people there are signs of a declining abundance and diversity of insects in various parts of the world yet the extent of the decline is controversial and varies both from one insect group to another and from region to region it is very likely that the main drivers are factors acting at landscape level which are related to structural transformations of landscapes habitat loss and changes in landscape management including forestry agriculture and other aspects related to human activity like urban development or atmospheric nitrogen input we are convinced that halting and reversing the decline of insects is a shared responsibility of our society that can only be tackled effectively by collaboration between all stakeholder groups involved aware of the importance of insect diversity for global ecosystems and for agriculture bayer is dedicated to developing and implementing measures to halt and reverse insect decline: products are only approved for the market if it can be shown that they do not affect non-target arthropod populations outside the treated areas new testing methods and risk assessment approaches for the safety of crop protection products are being continuously developed and improved innovative approaches in application technology can help to ensure as little exposure of non-target insects to pesticides as possible across all continents bayer is engaged in over 30 international collaboration projects with leading scientists and conservation institutes on cutting-edge research to protect pollinators and other insects background in recent years various scientific studies from different parts of the world have been recording declines in the abundance biodiversity or biomass of insects published data on this topic is diverse in geographic and taxonomic focus methodology time period covered and quality and not all studies report declining tendencies nevertheless available evidence suggests that there has in fact been a decline of insects; the extent of decline however is controversial and variable between different insect groups and different regions the reasons behind the declines are not yet fully understood; a multifactorial origin is very likely a variety of potential causative factors has been suggested but none of them has so far been confirmed as a main driver by strong scientific evidence our view considering all the available information it is very likely that the main drivers of insect decline are factors acting at landscape level which are related to structural transformations of landscapes habitat loss and changes in landscape management including forestry agriculture and other aspects related to human activity like urban development atmospheric nitrogen input or light pollution likewise changes in climate can influence the development of insect populations and the distribution ranges of insect species agriculture certainly contributes to the decline of insects for instance through changes in the structure of agricultural landscapes modifications of cropping practices nitrogen input large-scale monocultures reduced pasture grazing of livestock intensive grassland management and to some degree also crop protection on the other hand agriculture is not likely to be the sole factor as the recorded declines are not specific to agricultural landscapes but are also seen in conservation areas pesticides may play a certain role however there is no strong evidence pointing to them as a key driver although insecticides are used to control insect pests in the treated crops there are efficient measures in place to avoid adverse effects to insect populations outside the treatment areas moreover no systematic decline of insect pests has been observed which would have to be assumed if crop protection with insecticides was a significant causative factor bayer is dedicated to making a contribution to closing the knowledge gaps regarding the causes of insect decline conducting further research to elucidate causes and taking action to counter insect decline are not mutually exclusive and we know enough to act on insect protection our contributions bayer takes the decline of insects very seriously being well aware of the importance of insect diversity for global ecosystems and for agriculture we are dedicated to developing and implementing measures to halt and reverse insect decline we constantly make substantial efforts to minimize the impact of agriculture in general and of our products in particular on non-target insects eg through the following approaches and measures: bayer has committed to helping farmers apply more sustainable practices this will contribute to restoring and retaining the biodiversity of insects and other organisms combating climate change and making the most efficient use of natural resources in our research and development activities we strictly follow strategic approaches for the safety of our products and environmental compatibility is one of the criteria driving our business decisions as a standard procedure we comply with rigid testing and risk assessment requirements to ensure the safety of our products for non-target insects where possible we even proactively go beyond legal requirements for product safety environmental friendliness is an important criterion for us in product development decisions from early development phases onwards products are only approved for the market if it can be shown that they do not affect non-target arthropod biodiversity outside the treated areas and that they do not cause any adverse effects to the relevant function of the arthropod community even within the treated area regarding the environmental friendliness of our products we are constantly learning and strive for the continuous further improvement of their safety bayer is actively involved in the continuous adaptation of new testing methods and the development of new risk assessment approaches for the safety of crop protection products and traits for non-target insects that reflect the latest state of science in the area of application technology bayer is heavily involved in the development of innovative approaches to minimizing the exposure of non-target insects to pesticides – eg optimized planting machineries and improved seed coating for seed-applied products or the dropleg technology for foliar applied products where existing technical standards turned out not to be robust enough to ensure full protection even under worst-case conditions we proactively go for raising the standards with innovative technological and stewardship approaches eg after an accident with bee poisonings caused by a seed treatment product in germany 2008 bt crops are another effective approach for minimizing the exposure of non-target insects to insecticides and to reducing the use of insecticides with their selective mode of action they are harmless to insects other than the target pests since 2010 bayer has been jointly engaging in research with conservation institutes to develop optimized ecological enhancement measures that foster the biodiversity of insects in the agricultural landscape eg in the upper rhine valley in southern germany in other programs with independent research organizations we are investigating how insect biodiversity can increase the yield in selected crops and be protected as a part of agricultural production systems eg in apple orchards in germany and avocado plantations in chile in currently more than 30 international research collaboration projects with leading scientists on all continents we are advancing cutting-edge research to protect pollinators and other insects to address the decline of the monarch butterfly in the us the climate corporation developed the habitally app which is housed by iowa state university this app enables farmers and citizens to record their monarch habitat creation generates data for the united states fish and wildlife service and supports conservation efforts as monarch butterfly habitat can also support many other insect bird and mammal species in 2017 we established a cross-functional bayer working group on insect decline which brings together our expertise in disciplines related to the topic bayer experts from various disciplines are actively doing research into approaches for in-depth analysis of the causative factors behind the decline in research collaborations with independent scientists we evaluate data on potential factors behind insect decline and participate in the analysis of long-term monitoring data in addition we support independent research on insect decline and are engaged in dialogue with multiple stakeholders involved in the topic beyond these approaches bayer has developed an action plan comprising further activities which can help protect and restore insect biodiversity in the context of sustainable agriculture: more targeted and specific pesticide application and thereby further reduced exposure of non-target organisms by means of digital application technologies – including drone application toxicogenomic approaches to support a more targeted development of

relevant positions raising the bar on crop protection safety standards safety is our 1 priority and is embedded in everything we do bayer is committed to developing and stewarding safe solutions for farmers to meet the social environmental and economic needs of societies around the world in the face of the growing challenges that agriculture is confronted with today farmers need sustainable solutions to fulfill demand and crop protection products are of central importance in this context bayer trains more than one million farmers around the world per year on the safe handling of crop protection productswe recognize that there is a public debate on the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment while part of the debate is driven by emotions rather than facts we acknowledge that there is always room to be even better driven by our vision of “health for all hunger for none” we believe we can work together to address the interrelated challenges of ensuring food production and promoting sustainable agriculture to this end we make the following commitments safe products in addition to the regulatory requirements in countries where we register our products we apply our own internal safety standards these standards evolve based on the latest scientific knowledge and the standards of the majority of reference authorities the process of developing and registering a new crop protection product is extremely rigorous it takes 11 years on average between the first research tests and authorization and nearly €250 million of costs are associated with the discovery development and registration of a new active substance for every active substance that is registered for use there are about 160000 potential candidates that do not make it past the research stage bayer’s commitment to product safety goes beyond just meeting local regulatory requirements in 2012 we stopped selling any world health organization who acute class 1 pesticides regardless of regulatory approval status additionally since 2016 we have committed to only selling products with active ingredients that have a registration for use in at least one oecd country or for new active ingredients have a complete oecd safety data package we work to continuously incorporate new scientific knowledge into our risk assessments all new products are evaluated against our latest bayer safety standards leading to the constant improvement of our product portfolio for our assessment we apply criteria that reflect the standards of reference authorities who represent different agronomic realities and whose programs for regulating pesticides are generally well developed these include the regulatory authorities in the us canada brazil the eu australia new zealand japan and china we will continue to enhance this approach we will at the same time constantly review our current portfolio and make timely decisions wherever needed safe use we continue our efforts relating to the safe and sustainable use of pesticides and increase our support for training farmers to comply with label requirements and best management practices ensuring a pesticide’s safety starts early in its development is pursued throughout the government registration process and continues years after it enters the market our products are safe when used according to label instructions this requires clear labels that can be easily understood and the training of farmers to comply with the label and apply best management practices in compliance with fao’s code of conduct on pesticide management bayer trained more than one million farmers around the world in 2019 focusing on training activities in countries where there are no statutory protection requirements or certification for users regarding the safe handling of crop protection products bayer also organizes safety training for its own employees and contract workers from outside companies in particular for sales force employees regarding label language we follow the fao guidelines on good labelling practice for pesticides and the globally harmonized system ghs for the classification and labelling of chemicals to compile global label references for our products in countries in transition our local regulatory colleagues use these references to advocate for the ghs system and achieve label improvements moreover we evaluate local use scenarios to ensure products are only placed on the market when the required personal protective equipment has proven suitable for the country at the same time we work with industry governments and distributors to make personal protective equipment increasingly available to farmers bayer continuously monitors the use of its pesticides in all markets and conditions in order to guide decisions on more sustainable product ideas label changes or enhanced training and product stewardship measures to support farmers in the safe use of our products in addition new advancements in formulation and application technology can help reduce operator exposure and environmental impact we foster the professional application of pesticides in areas where the use of adequate protective equipment is not common practice in asia for example where smallholder farmers have historically relied on backpack sprayers we collaborate with drone technology providers to make pesticide application more precise and safer for smallholder farmers and the environment in africa we support the croplife africa middle east concept of spray service providers ssps who are trained and certified for applying crop protection products safely the ssp concept has been successfully introduced in 14 african countries so far with more than 12000 ssps find out more about our ongoing stewardship measures innovation the continuous review and evaluation of our current commercial portfolio against relevant social environmental and economic parameters help us to identify areas that need attention and develop action plans to encourage the development of new innovative and more sustainable solutions we work with regulators and other stakeholders to ensure effective and predictive science- and risk-based regulatory systems that enable this innovation we are convinced that an innovative and well-filled toolbox for farmers – including crop protection products – is essential for increasing the sustainability of farming thanks to such tools farmers are able to reduce the environmental impact earn a decent income and contribute to local economies while providing society with affordable high quality and safe farm products spare land and resources bayer is investing €23 billion annually in innovative farming solutions with approximately 7800 r&d employees in more than 50 countries we aim to provide new technologies to farmers all over the world the continuous review and evaluation of our current commercial portfolio against relevant social environmental and economic parameters help us to identify areas that need attention and develop action plans to encourage the development of new innovative solutions that can contribute to sustainable farming these action plans may include research projects reformulations or replacing one product with an alternative product bayer has also committed to collaborating with farmers to reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture bayer aims to reduce the field greenhouse gas emissions – per kilogram of crops produced in major agricultural markets – and the environmental impact of crop protection by 30 percent by 2030 in each case to this end bayer will help farmers apply more sustainable practices such as reducing tillage to help sequester carbon in the soil and ensuring the more precise use of crop protection and fertilizer through product innovation and digital tools to enable innovation and bring farmers the tools they need to farm sustainably we continue to work with regulators and other stakeholders on predictable and effective science- and risk-based safety assessments and we will use our safety standards to substantiate these discussions in countries where safety standards are still in development we engage with relevant stakeholders to support the setting up of effective safety assessments trust we aim to be more open and transparent about our safety standards and how we fulfill our commitment to applying them consistently this is how we want to contribute to the open dialog necessary to maintaining and increasing trust in safety data the regulatory systems that evaluate them and the approval of crop protection products over the past few years we have intensified the dialog with critical stakeholders and it is our shared objective to make crop protection safer for farm workers and consumers and to reduce adverse effects on the environment by enabling access to our safety studies in the context of our transparency program we embarked on a path to increase societal and public understanding of the science of evaluating risk we will follow and intensify this path when it comes to our safety standards we believe this is necessary in times where the perception of safety is disconnected from the reality of the high level of safety we enjoy today where an idealized view of nature undermines trust in innovation and public institutions and where there is a growing divide between farmers and consumers with transparency and a willingness to engage in continually evolving safety standards we want to help build trust in the regulatory system for the approval of pesticides we have initiated a process to make our safety standards transparent and available to authorities around the world on this basis we will seek open dialog with all stakeholders involved and encourage others to join us in this effort we expect that with openness in the debate we can increase trust and realize a high level of safety while at the same time providing farmers with the tools they need with these commitments we continue to build on international standards as laid out in the pesticide code of conduct of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and support the work of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to improve and harmonize testing and risk assessment methodologies as well as pesticide registration processes across countries and regions links our

land per head is a global challenge for the agricultural industry the ground needs to be cultivated in an environmentally friendly and resource-saving manner that increases the yields and quality of harvest by approximately one half by 2050 compared to 2012 according to the united nations the global population is expected to grow from just over 7 billion in 2012 to almost 10 billion people by then at the same time biodiversity must be protected and greenhouse gas emissions drastically reduced this calls for a combination of a wide range of measures and new solutions – including developing high-yield stress-resistant varieties and using climate-friendly resource-saving methods that above all avoid plowing that releases co2 and use water crop protection products and fertilizers more

promotion of new talent bayer 04 leverkusen culture our views on bayer’s position on sustainable beef production background there are approximately 1 billion cattle in the world today a number that has been flat for the past decade but is expected to rise by 30% over the next 30 years as diets change around the world livestock production globally is responsible for 145% of all greenhouse gas emissions and cattle production is the largest emitter within the livestock sector about 10% of the global feed for cattle comes from grain with 57% coming from grass and leaves and the remainder coming from crop residues such as corn stalks feed production and processing make up 45% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions this has been correctly identified as a major risk to agriculture that if not addressed by industry will be addressed by government fortunately according to the fao wider adoption of current best practices in feeding health and husbandry and manure management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in livestock by 30% research shows that beef production is getting more efficient and more sustainable for example in the us beef production has increased from 16 billion pounds in 1960 to 27 billion pounds in 2018 while reducing the size of the herd from 978 million to 885 million bayer’s position global meat consumption is projected to only increase into the future as an innovation company in agriculture we believe farmers are at the center of the best possible solutions to our current and future environmental challenges bayer is committed to being a partner with these farmers and others to help sustainably meet the growing demands of the world for protein while helping to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the beef industry through innovation bayer supports and respects local diets and empowers farmers from all backgrounds and practices to support themselves their families and their communities in 2018 bayer committed to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions in production agriculture by 30% through innovation and collaboration with our customers and supply chains for bayer farmers and ranchers who are stewards of the land are not just part of the solution they actually are the solution amid the growing global demand for their products what bayer is doing bayer is leading the research efforts where we have expertise and we are investing in areas where we can partner to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions including in the life cycle of cattle where bayer is leading reducing the carbon footprint of corn production through driving increased productivity on existing corn acres6 promoting farming practices that sequester carbon in the soil and assisting farmers in quantifying their impact 7 developing the next generation of corn – short corn – which will further increase productivity and reduce emissions 8 where bayer is investing microbials that may someday help plants fixate nitrogen from the air and therefore reduce the need for fertilizer produced from natural gas alternative proteins that can help supplement the meat supply to meet increasing protein demand of societies around the world where bayer can partner leveraging our world class breeding organization to improve the quality of feed to improve feed efficiency advocating for the spread of industry leading practices to improve the efficiency of meat production across the whole value chain through partnerships such as our better life farming initiative work with stakeholders to share industry leading efforts on sustainability to ensure our sector

transparency in our collaboration with stakeholders and decision makers updates to this non-exhaustive list of political positions will continuously be made available the positions listed below provide an overview of the overarching positions of the company and therefore can be seen as guidelines for our political engagement animal studies animal studies: essential for safe medicines and crop protection agents topic animal studies are an important element in the research and development process for medicines and crop protection agents around 90% of the studies performed at bayer are required by law in order to ensure that innovative active substances and products are effective and safe for people animals and the environment all other animal study projects eg in basic research are only permitted if no research methods that do not involve animals are available and the project fulfills all the other requirements of a clearly structured application and notification process thus enabling the authorities to determine that the project is essential the similarities between humans and other mammals allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn from these studies regarding the action of investigational substances in the human body this has enabled a large number of vaccines and medicines to be developed for the treatment of conditions such as cardiovascular diseases cancer or the immune disorder aids toxicology studies performed in animals are also a legal requirement within the development process for crop protection agents the performance of such studies is regulated in detail in the corresponding legislation and compliance with the regulations is monitored by the competent authorities animal welfare committees in which animal welfare associations are represented are involved in the process in an advisory capacity in addition to national animal welfare regulations a large number of agreements operate within the international research community to ensure uniform standards yet animal studies are repeatedly the subject of controversial discussion the research-based companies take the public’s reservations seriously and are working on an ongoing basis to develop alternative test methods in order to reduce the number of animal studies these methods include studies using tissue samples and computer simulations however they can as yet only replace animal studies to a limited extent and the authorities have approved them as a replacement for animal studies in only a limited number of areas bayer position bayer performs animal studies for products for medicine and agricultural applications and is fully aware of its responsibility the company has drawn up strict guidelines for animal welfare and animal studies and has set them out in a binding policy bayer also applies the 3r principle in its research activities the aim of which is to reduce the number of animals used in studies refine research methods and replace animal studies with alternative methods all our animal studies comply with the animal welfare legislation in force bayer’s principles on animal welfare and animal studies apply to our production facilities partners and suppliers in countries where no special legislation exists an internal animal welfare committee at bayer monitors compliance with these principles we provide appropriate living conditions for the animals we also reduce the number of examinations and stressful procedures associated with interventions by using techniques such as micro-computed tomography and remote sensing measuring methods the performance of all animal studies is additionally monitored by our animal welfare officers bayer collaborates intensively with stakeholders at national and international level to develop alternative methods in order to achieve a continuous reduction in the number of animal studies bayer also provides financial and other forms of support for related projects in view of the fact that it often takes more than 12 years to develop and obtain marketing authorization for innovative medicines and crop protection agents bayer calls for predictable and reliable approval procedures that enable the company to plan within reliable time frames and to provide safe and innovative products for patients and farmers with the shortest possible delay bayer is open to an intensive dialogue with all stakeholders with the aim of jointly identifying the best solutions for animal welfare science patients and farmers more information is available at:

the import regulations for the importing countries and acquire product approvals in countries in which the products are due to be marketed we have specified our principles of responsible product management in our new product stewardship commitment principles and key requirements guideline these principles are based on established and internationally recognized standards such as the code of conduct on the handling of pesticides issued by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the specifications for crop protection products of the association croplife international and the guidelines of the industry initiative excellence through stewardship ets for seeds and traits research and development we use the latest technologies to develop products and services so that we can optimize their efficacy productivity and safety for people and the environment as part of the testing process chemical and biological crop protection products are examined early in the development phase with regard to their mode of action their ecotoxicological properties and the extent of potential residues in plants and the environment to ensure that only those products with the best safety profile are developed further the development of genetically modified seeds is also subject to stringent international and national laws and regulations we have specified internal processes in a corporate policy to ensure a responsible approach to biotechnologically manufactured products throughout their life cycle more processes in plant biotechnology in the cultivation of new crops crop science uses both conventional and new targeted cultivation techniques to develop robust high-quality plants that deliver high yields even under difficult conditions we want to provide farmers with innovative solutions that enable them to produce more food for a growing population and at the same time reduce the environmental impact of our products we also support the responsible use of different cultivation techniques biotechnology helps us to develop solutions that strenhen plants’ resistance to insects weeds and other environmental stresses such as drought in a targeted manner using a variety of molecular approaches including new gene editing tools like crispr we transfer beneficial traits such as the ability to resist a pest or to use water more efficiently to a crop plant so that it can better survive in its environment biotechnology enables more productive farming and increases the sustainability of agriculture by for example facilitating minimum tillage practices which preserve topsoil and reduce co2 emissions more transparency in marketing sales and distribution in its distribution of crop protection products and technologies crop science observes the international code of conduct on pesticide management of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations we have also made relevant voluntary commitments since 2016 we have marketed only crop protection products with active ingredients that have a registration in at least one oecd country and only new active ingredients for which an oecd data package has been compiled in the future we aim to set even higher standards and are reviewing new procedures to introduce crop protection products in emerging markets only if they satisfy both the local safety standards in the respective country and the requirements of leading relevant regulatory authorities bayer aims to strenhen our customers’ and stakeholders’ confidence in our products through transparency which is very important to our company we have made safety-related data on our crop protection products transparent more than 230 summaries of scientific studies submitted to the european food safety authority in connection with the registration procedures for 28 of our active ingredients in the european union are already available on an online platform these documents include information on toxicological and ecotoxicological studies and investigations into degradability more on voluntary commitments and on transparency responsible use responsibility for customers and partners the application of crop protection products requires the greatest possible care supporting our customers and partners in the proper and safe handling of our seed and crop protection products is therefore a focus of our product stewardship through targeted training courses we teach farmers seed treatment professionals and dealers how to use our products both effectively to increase the yield and quality of their harvested goods and also safely with regard to human health and the environment in 2020 crop science replaced numerous on-site personal training activities with virtual measures due to the covid-19 pandemic it was thus able to increase the number of farmers trained to around 17 million farmers worldwide we focus our safe use training activities on countries where there are no statutory certification requirements for the handling of crop protection products we conduct training both independently and in cooperation with local regional and international associations as a member of croplife international we help to train nearly four million farmers in this association in 82 countries in the responsible and appropriate use of crop protection products environmental safety – crop protection products in the environment responsible care is extremely important in all areas of agriculture to minimize possible effects and the discharge of crop protection products outside of the treated crops protecting good surface and groundwater quality are cornerstones of the responsible use of water as a natural resource therefore the application of crop protection products is subject to national water protection regulations including in europe the requirements of the water framework directive we place particular importance on water protection and support agriculture in environmentally friendly land cultivation and the disposal of residual liquids following the application of crop protection products in order to avoid surface or even groundwater contamination in this context we promote the biological remediation system phytobac™ to our customers this system is designed to prevent water contamination with residues of crop protection chemicals generated during the filling and cleaning of spraying devices or the disposal of residual liquids new technologies not only enable crop production to be increased but also promote the safe and responsible use of crop protection products this includes the targeted application of crop protection products using data from satellites and drones more protection of bees and other pollinators bees and other pollinators are hugely important for sustainable food production our pollinator research activities support farmers in food production while at the same time contributing to the health safety and biodiversity of pollinators to minimize potential risks posed to bees by our crop protection products initial tests to measure bee toxicity are carried out already at an early development stage the goal here is to ensure that only products with a pollinator-safe environmental profile are developed further neonicotinoids are the subject of controversial debate with regard to bee safety these highly effective insecticides protect plants from a broad array of pests and are therefore widespread the effects observed under laboratory conditions did not harm bee colonies under realistic field conditions when the products were used properly more product stewardship for glyphosate glyphosate has a 40-year history of safe use when used according to label directions this is confirmed by science-based evaluations conducted by regulatory bodies such as the european food safety authority efsa and the german federal institute for risk assessment bfr and other leading regulatory authorities such as the us environmental protection agency epa and the canadian department of health health canada extensive information on the public debate surrounding the safety of glyphosate for users and the environment is available on our website for information on the lawsuits against bayer in the united states please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements in

different views to the table and to facilitate constructive and outcome-based discussions in this regard we would like to highlight the following joint statement that has been developed by bayer and involved investors to speak out publicly on a specific engagement project and to display its impact joint statement the engagement bayer’s esg investor engagement team holds a joint engagement project with a number of institutional investors who are ready to actively engage on esg matters with the aim to improve mutual understanding thus supporting bayer to progress in line with investor expectations to strenhen trust in the investor sphere and to facilitate further esg-based investments in the capital markets the dialogue started in late 2021 and investors with more than €46 trillion assets under management1 are involved including generali insurance asset management union investment and northern trust asset management the engagement activities comprise topics like environmental impact reduction in crop protection product safety and stewardship in crop protection and sustainability governance amongst others 1 as computed by investors bayer’s testimonial the exchange is of great importance for us as it helps us to better understand investors’ perspectives on esg matters and their specific information needs and it has had its noticeable impact especially in terms of our once more extended disclosure that serves as a proof for our transparency pathway moreover it generates additional input for our internal resource allocation sharpens our strategy and will result in better impact” matthias berninger head of public affairs science sustainability & hse “the engagement supported us to get deeper insights into investors’ perspectives on our environmental impact reduction target to better understand their approach to sustainability governance and to rethink our disclosures and processes in light of investors’ expectations whose fulfillment required a joint effort within the organization concerning product stewardship in crop protection the engagement helped to close certain disclosure gaps eg on our safety commitments and on product monitoring where we are now figuring out the potential for further robust data points that could be reported externally at the same time we got a better understanding of investors’ expectations re governance mechanisms and internal reporting in the area of scientific affairs we specified our disclosure on ghostwriting that is strictly prohibited while we tried to be more specific on our already existing policies on lobbying we see the increased information need on this topic and are therefore in the process of conducting a consolidated lobbying report we also fixed the integration of esg in m&a in the bayer regulations” dr klaus kunz head of esg strategy “the whole engagement has been effective because of a constructive spirit that has been fed by each investor’s input while every single investor valuably contributed to the discussion we would like to emphasize the work and readiness of generali insurance asset management who has taken a notable role in initiating and structuring the

research in its societal environment our focus in this is on the natural sciences life sciences and agricultural science environment protection technology and medicine a significant share of our funding goes to the bayer science & education foundation whose work includes funding endowment chairs conferring science awards and supporting young people through pupils’ and scholarship programs leading-edge research and scientific prizes basic research and industrial research are an investment in future development and added value that is why the bayer science & education foundation honors outstanding research achievements with various science awards every two years the hansen family award and the otto bayer award each worth €75000 are presented to researchers in german-speaking countries the hansen family award honors pioneering achievements in basic medical research that have the potential to sustainably improve healthcare and the treatment of illnesses the otto bayer award honors scientists from german-speaking countries who have made pioneering research contributions in innovative fields of chemistry and biochemistry with its talent awards bayer specifically supports creative junior researchers in the early stages of their career the annual bayer early excellence in science award honors biologists chemists and medical scientists who gained their phd no more than five years previously and whose work has clearly contributed to new insights in their fields of research the biennial thrombosis award honors junior researchers for their outstanding achievements in basic and clinical thrombosis research the international fellowship program with its six scholarship schemes supports students and young professionals in scientific and medical disciplines the most important criterion for funding is that applicants work on an innovative and internationally oriented project scholarships are awarded to students and young professionals in the following disciplines:

young physician leaders program allows young medical talents to attend the world health summit the world’s largest international medical congress a cornerstone of bayer’s work in the field of agricultural education is the youth ag program which aims to get youngsters young adults and scientists in the 14-28 age group enthusiastic about agricultural topics a key aspect of this program is that it enables young people to attend the one-week young ag summit where young thought leaders meet to discuss sustainable farming solutions that will help to feed the growing global population school support the earlier meaningful educational support begins the better bayer takes this principle to heart by starting its promotion of the natural sciences in schools some of the numerous projects have won awards and are seen as model projects the bayer foundation’s program supports schools located near bayer sites in germany in their efforts to make science lessons more interesting by means of innovative projects each year funds totaling €500000 are available for this school support in our baylabs we give children and young people the chance to carry out exciting experiments in the fields of health biology nutrition and medicine – on their own but with professional supervision in this way they get to know hands-on science at first hand currently we have 16 baylabs close to our sites in ten countries around the world another component of the bayer foundations scientific funding is cooperation with major events and conferences in 2019 “mind the lab” took place as part of the berlin science week a berlin initiative in which scientists in berlins subway stations show experiments and thus draw attention to science the baylabs and the bayer foundation were taking part at this

sites of ig farben view of the memorial for victims of forced labor at ig farben’s lower rhine sites located next to bayer headquarters in leverkusen germany © marcus mueller saran to promote a company culture guided by remembrance and reflection bayer has built a memorial for the victims of forced labor at ig farben during the second world war next to its headquarters in leverkusen the memorial honors the approximately 16000 forced laborers from numerous occupied countries in europe who were deployed at the lower rhine sites to expand production from 1940 to 1945 according to available documents approximately one-third of these forced laborers were women most were between 17-23 years old when they arrived and there were also children among them the memorial was designed and built by an interdisciplinary group of artists and designers led by professor jussi ängeslevä from art+com studios the intent was to create a physical and artistic interpretation of an original dataset containing information from the bayer archives about the approximately 16000 people located at the very heart of the company in leverkusen the place is also designed to enable an individual engagement with the past the computationally designed sculpture of wood steel and living plants will intentionally transform over time due to the forces of nature reminding employees and visitors that remembering the past is imperative when thinking of the future the physical installation is augmented by a site-specific mobile app that helps visitors decipher its unique form and obtain impressions of various data: from spatial references to demographic details and personnel documents of 26 forced laborers of ig farben who are quoted verbatim the examples reveal the fates of the forced laborers and make the perspective of those responsible explicitly clear the memorial was inaugurated in may 2023 among the guests were werner baumann the mayor of leverkusen uwe richrath johannes finkelstein and members of bayer’s works council © marcus mueller saran “remembrance of the injustice suffered by the approximately 16000 individuals at the lower rhine sites must inform our moral awareness it

circumstances based on their fields crops and environmental pressures all of which need careful consideration and an integrated set of solutions to be successful so as we at bayer design tomorrow’s agricultural innovations we know each one we bring to market must be tailored to meet the needs of individual farmers and their fields when we seek to understand these individual needs we become capable of finding ways to better support our customers through the digitalization of our pipeline supply chain and daily interactions with farmers we know more than ever about our customers and their fields and how our products are used and how they perform by digitally connecting farmers with these insights we can provide the solutions that best support the decisions they make every day from planting to harvest find out more about our r&d pipeline data that helps find better answers climate fieldview™ is a software platform that enables farmers to have a complete picture of their operation using more than 250 layers of data and billions of data points farmers are able to monitor field variability design their fields optimize inputs and stop problems before they start these digital tools help farmers make smart seed and seeding decisions by guiding them on how to use nitrogen and crop protection tools like herbicides more efficiently reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide runoff into water these tools can also alert farmers about real-time in-field conditions helping them make informed decisions about the timing type and amount of inputs that might be required at any given moment by using data to understand their fields and to better manage their crops and yields farmers can grow enough while using less land energy and water products that reduce our impact farmers understand the importance of stewarding their land and preserving the environment generally seeking out practices and products that help them reduce their impact and improve environmental sustainability for example since 2013 farmers in south america have planted millions of hectares of intacta™ soybean seeds which require fewer pesticides allowing them to adopt more sustainable practices the result keeping 68 billion kilograms of carbon – the equivalent of 33 million cars – in the ground where it belongs with the benefit of enhanced weed and pest control farmers have reduced their carbon emissions by spending less time in the tractor applying crop protection products and even more good news these reduced- and no-till practices still allow them to maintain their yields an even more precise application tomato farmers in mexico have discovered a way to cultivate harvests while using fewer natural resources in collaboration with netafim we’ve developed the dripbydrip irrigation system which applies crop protection products in the right quantities at the right time through drip irrigation this system means better tomato harvests using fewer inputs 00:00

saturated with microorganisms — a tablespoon of soil could contain up to 50 billion of them in agriculture many products are now being developed that contain microbes or that are derived from microbes microbial solutions may be applied to the surface of seeds directly in the soil or to plants themselves to complement — or provide an alternative to — chemical agricultural products by combining traditional and biological crop protections growers can help to improve resistance management narrowly target certain pest insects or reduce residues in fruits and vegetables while providing effective protection from pests and disease microbes are also a rich source of natural substances that can be used to enhance crop production a new approach to delivering the next generation of biologicals is to harness microbes to make specific natural substances with synthetic biology we can enlist existing organisms to produce compounds which can help in the areas of crop protection nitrogen fixation and carbon sequestration it works by giving microbes new capabilities similar to how bacteria are used to produce insulin for people with diabetes rather than sourcing it from animal organs bayer has partnered with ginkgo bioworks’ agricultural synthetic biologicals platform in a multi-year collaboration focused on next-generation programs including the continuation of bayer’s work on nitrogen fixation through enhanced microbials botanical natural products some plants naturally produce biochemicals that can be concentrated for use in agriculture these biologicals are often called botanicals or plant extracts bayer is partnered with kimitec to advance and establish biological solutions derived from natural sources including crop protection products that address pests diseases and weeds as well as biostimulants to promote plant growth biological pheromones biological pheromones also called semiochemicals present a non-toxic innovative opportunity for biological crop protection while safeguarding biodiversity and beneficial pollinators by mimicking the signals that insects use to navigate or find a mate pheromones can prevent harmful insect populations from growing these

wilting browning molding and rotting through a combination of scientific innovations technology and products we offer farmers tailored solutions to not only spot disease early but prevent it from taking hold altogether using data science and artificial intelligence to identify diseases early through the use of artificial intelligence known as machine learning today we are able to discover and diagnose crop diseases in real time right from the field the ability to identify and address diseases quickly can have a huge impact on a farmer’s time resources and ultimately the productivity of their crops the rise of digitalization and data has opened a wealth of new opportunities for farmers remote sensors satellites and drones can monitor plant health soil conditions temperature nitrogen utilization and much more 24/7 artificial intelligence ai tools can then analyze data at high speeds and funnel it back to farmers in the form of useful insights helping them make critical timely in-field decisions for example just a few years ago growers may have only noticed and acted upon disease pressure once it was widespread in their fields and visible to the naked eye now thanks to these high-tech tools even small breakouts of disease can be detected early on and growers can be alerted to that information in real time allowing them to come up with a mitigation plan quickly and treat just those areas in a targeted manner rather than spraying an entire field learn how digital farming is shaping the future of agriculture 00:00 microbials to support plant health microbes are microscopic organisms in the soil in many cases they can have a symbiotic relationship with plants helping crops thrive in agriculture we are developing products containing microbes that can be applied to plants or seeds to complement — or provide an alternative to — chemical crop protection products these products are referred to as agricultural biologicals in addition to exploring biological crop protectants bayer is working to create microbials that use beneficial fungi bacteria and other microorganisms to help plants better absorb nutrients and ward off pests and disease discover how agricultural biologicals help protect farmers’ crops controlling the threat of fungal pathogens the most common crop diseases are spread by fungi that finde their way to leaf surfaces where environmental elements like the wind and rain help spread their spores to nearby plants posing a serious threat to a farmer’s crop it is estimated that fungal pathogens are responsible for crop losses of up to 30% worldwide innovative solutions like fungicides are a critical tool for farmers to control the spread of fungi-borne diseases fungicides work by inhibiting the growth of the fungus or destroying it completely thereby enabling crop plants to thrive on at bayer we work to provide fungicides that help farmers combat fungi and diseases and are safe for the environment and the food supply 00:00 plant breeding and biotechnology for disease resistance humans have been using plant breeding techniques to improve food and crops for thousands of years one way to harness modern plant breeding is to develop varieties that are naturally disease resistent by cross-breeding plants that have shown a natural resistance to certain diseases we can create crops more likely to thrive despite the threat of plant disease in the 1980s scientists began using biotechnology a method of transferring beneficial genes conferring desirable traits like disease resistance directly plants in a faster more efficient and precise fashion that through traditional breeding techniques a great example of this successful approach is the disease-resistant rainbow papaya before the introduction of this variety in 1988 the hawaiian papaya industry was being devastated by the papaya ringspot virus using biotechnology scientists developed the rainbow papaya by inserting a gene that allowed the

often eliminating the need for topical insecticides and providing more precise control for deterring only targeted insects to protect the harvest potential of plants and decrease pesticide use insect-resistant traits in genetically modified plants using bt bacillus thuringiensis a naturally occurring soil bacterium were developed crops with bt traits have been modified to produce certain proteins that are toxic to various forms of insect larvae bt proteins have long been used as topical sprays in conventional and organic agriculture because they are effective and can be used safely crops that are genetically engineered to carry a bt trait allow farmers to protect their crops while potentially eliminating or significantly decreasing the amount of insecticides sprayed – this also means that only insects that are eating the crops are affected protecting beneficial and non-targeted insects in the ecosystem leveraging refuge areas another practice farmers have available to them in their fight against insects involves creating refuge areas refuge areas are designated portions of a field where plants that insects find appetizing are planted giving them a safe place to eat their fill while leaving the farmers’ crops alone typically refuge areas are planted among bt crops to stave off the development of insect resistance to the bt gene digital farming and data analytics have the potential to help farmers strategically place refuge areas in and around fields based on the type of insect expected to feed there how far the insect is willing to travel for food and how hospitable the land is for growing crops 00:00 supporting biodiversity and pollinators pollinating insects such as bees butterflies and flies play an important role in the cultivation of many crops especially fruits vegetables and nuts bayer recognizes the critical role pollinators play for agriculture and the environment to ensure pollinators have the foraging grounds necessary for survival we work with farmers to set best practices like creating buffer and refuge areas and planting pollinator attractant plants integrated pest management combined with recent ag tech innovations provide farmers with the opportunity to use less land while producing enough to feed the world’s growing population learn more about pollinators learn more about crop protection accessibilityag biologicalsag biologicals -

have leading research & development capabilities in biotechnology to deliver tailored solutions to farmers faster than ever before plant breeding is as old as agriculture itself farmers and scientists have long used plant breeding techniques making use of the plants natural genetic diversity to improve beneficial characteristics in plants such as increased yield drought tolerance or improved taste for example in the 1980s scientists began using biotechnology a method of transferring beneficial genes directly into a plant which allowed for greater efficiency and new opportunities for improving crops this process is called genetic modification and the result is a genetically modified organism gmo or genetically modified seed gm seed the production of these products has accelerated the delivery of more resilient productive crops developing gm seeds the process of bringing a gm seed from initial testing through market availability is complex requiring significant investments in time and resources on average it takes 13 years and costs $130 million to bring a gm seed to market the process involves several steps once scientists have identified genes that have the potential to improve a crop give it a minute: gmos 1:26 00:00 step 1 the desired trait such as insect resistance or drought tolerance is identified in a natural organism step 2 a copy of the gene responsible for the desired trait is transferred into a plant step 3 the new plant is tested to ensure that it is safe for people animals and the environment each new gm genetically modified seed undergoes years of testing to ensure that it brings value to farmers and is as safe as its non-gm counterpart step 4 only after rigorous reviews by scientists and government regulators around the world seeds from the new plant are approved to be made available to farmers benefits of growing gm crops if you’re wondering why many farmers choose to grow gm crops it helps to consider the challenges they face: using natural resources more efficiently some gm corn crops can help protect harvests in water-limited conditions and drought-stricken areas other gmos can promote the practice of no-till farming which helps keep moisture and nutrients in the soil no-till also means fields require fewer passes with machinery resulting in a reduction in fuel demands and greenhouse gases emitted fighting pests and disease several gm crops have been modified to be resistant to insects and plant-specific diseases that can devastate a field plants modified with traits that protect roots from insect damage use water more efficiently than those with damaged roots conserving natural habitats gm seeds can help farmers around the world meet the increasing demand to grow enough by helping them make the most of their existing arable land thus enabling them to preserve nearby habitats 00:00 which crops are gmos gmos are imported grown and/or field-tested in more than 75 countries while regulations regarding gmos vary from country to country there are currently 13 crops with gm varieties commercially available around the world alfalfa apple canola corn maize cotton eggplant papaya pineapple potato soybeans squash sugar beets sugarcane some other foods you might recognize in the grocery store are the result of traditional plant breeding and are not gmos: seedless watermelon grape tomatoes tangelos broccolini baby carrots 00:00 safety and transparency in biotechnology at bayer we are passionate about achieving food security and safety healthy nutrition and well-being for all and preserving ecosystems in line with the united nations sustainable development goals we place the highest priority on the safety of our products and are committed to transparency and dialogue gm seeds have been safety tested more than any other crop in the history of agriculture regulatory authorities around the world have concluded that gm crops are as safe for humans animals and the environment as non-gm crops world health organization “gm foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health in addition no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved” national academies of science engineering and medicine “…the study committee found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between currently commercialized genetically engineered ge crops and conventionally bred crops nor did it find conclusive cause-and-effect evidence of environmental problems from the ge crops” learn more about our commitment to safety and transparency providing farmers with more choice by

all through a scientific process known as genome editing the promise genome editing holds to drive advancements in agriculture is just as inspiring building a better blueprint at bayer we believe that solving farmers’ ever increasing and complex problems ensuring food security and preserving our planet’s natural resources will not be achievable without innovation in agriculture including the use of new techniques such as genome-editing in agriculture genome editing typically looks to improve a beneficial trait or to deactivate an undesirable trait within a plant to increase yield improve resilience to increasingly extreme weather conditions or reduce the need for inputs such as pesticides or fungicides for example for years “genome editing” was done through traditional breeding methods which selected plants based on their desirable characteristics and how they react in the environment scientists worked at the speed of the crop’s growth cycle to produce new varieties over a decade or more but with an ever-increasing understanding of genetics and the discovery of genome editing tools like crispr we can now “fine-tune” a plant’s own genetic make-up to create more quickly precisely and predictably desired traits and therefore a better crop many changes introduced by genome editing are comparable to changes that are naturally present by the millions in a plant’s dna all the time while small these changes can have significant impact enabling scientists to: improve resilience to increasingly extreme weather conditions including drought increase yield resist existing and emerging disease and pests thus reducing inputs eg pesticides herbicides and fertilizers respond to changing consumer demands and preferences by increasing shelf-life nutritional value or improving flavor and appearance adapt to new agronomic systems 00:00 this technology therefore has the potential to solve some of the ever increasing and complex challenges faced by farmers consumers and the planet how is bayer using gene editing we are exploring the application of genome editing in the development of seed and microbial products to both accelerate and expand the range of solutions and alleviate the global pressures that are putting both food security and the future of our planet at risk bayer’s r&d focus areas for genome editing include improvements to plant architecture or plant body itself improved yield quality and disease resistance centered on our row crop portfolio short corn growing next to traditional corn in the marana arizona greenhouse one of our most exciting concepts is short stature corn which grows 30 to 40 percent shorter than traditional hybrids but with comparable yield per corn ear we are exploring short stature corn through multiple technology approaches including traditional breeding biotechnology and genome editing utilizing multiple technologies will allow us to create the highest quality crop and bring this innovation into the broadest possible geographies and environments covercress beneath the surface bayer owns a 65 percent majority ownership of covercress inc covercress™ is a low-input winter oilseed cover crop which has been developed using genome editing to convert pennycress into a commodity crop by improving its oil quality and feed value while also allowing the plant to serve as a winter cover crop between corn harvest and soybean planting covercress™ offers the benefits of a traditional cover crop such as suppressing weeds mitigating soil erosion and reducing water and nutrient loss it also shows the potential to sequester carbon in the soil as a high-protein animal feed and source for renewable biofuel production it provides a new revenue stream farmers and is therefore -

forwardfarming transparency crop protection gmo crops plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us safety is paramount in any industry and agriculture is no different the protection of input manufacturers growers and workers on the farm value chain partners as well as consumers is absolutely essential as is the preservation of the environment in agriculture we refer to the responsible and ethical management of a product throughout its lifecycle—from the research development and testing of products to their production and delivery to growers to their application and disposal —as product stewardship proper product stewardship practices are central to ensuring the availability of high-quality products services and best practices by promoting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements helping facilitate trade maximizing product potential and sustainability and minimizing risks to people and the environment read the bayer position on product stewardship in the agricultural business as an industry leader in agriculture we’re uniquely positioned to help promote safe and productive agricultural operations around the world this is why we work diligently to ensure that our products services and technologies are safe sustainable and environmentally responsible while meeting grower expectations and needs a key part of this is ensuring that our employees and growers are trained to use our products safely ecologically and effectively—from the handling and application of the products to the disposal of empty containers the importance of empty container management wherever pesticides are used empty containers are generatedit’s an ongoing problem; one that poses a serious threat to the environment and public health food and agriculture organization fao of united nations the main environmental and human safety concerns related to crop protection containers include: plastic waste in the environment unsafe disposal options eg on-site incineration remnants ending up in water sources reuse of containers for water or food misuse of empty containers eg for playing safe use training and empty container management our product responsibility efforts span the value chain—from the research development and testing of products to their production and delivery to growers to their application and disposal learn more about product stewardship across the value chain when working with growers and the value chain our product responsibility efforts focus on trainings on the safe use of pesticides for operators consumers and the environment – in line with the international code of conduct for pesticide management who fao 2014 to do so we leverage new technologies and services of handling applying and disposing of crop protection products; and also promote responsible empty container management systems especially in countries with less regulated waste management systems to live up to our commitment to promote the safe use of crop protection products and tools we are: providing knowledge platforms to foster best practice exchange on the safe use of pesticides including translating the fao code of conduct for pesticide management into actions with a focus on low- and middle-income countries holding in-person dedicated safe-use trainings embedded trainings eg as part of product launches and joint trainings with other partners investing in the preparation of quality digital trainings and ongoing e-learning so safe use know-how is available to anyone with an internet connection eg: in 2020 we reached out to more than 1 million farmers with information on the safe usage of pesticides by increasingly using digital training opportunities when in-person trainings were not possible for health reasons during the height of covid-19 in china between february and april 2020 live online safe use trainings reached more than 170000 farmers disseminating the “safe use” message and taking a “train the trainer” approach to multiply our efforts and reach promoting new ways of applying crop protection such as drones demonstrating safe use and proper empty container disposal via external platforms such as the bayer forwardfarming network safe use harbor in china bayer dresscode and the baygap training tool facilitating safe and environmentally responsible means to dispose and recycle empty plastic pesticide containers leveraging new technologies and services for handling disposing and recycling of pesticide containers engaging in local waste management systems to reduce plastic being placed into the environment in cooperation with croplife international promoting the recycling of our packaging into recommended end uses such as plastic tubes fence posts and cables partnering with universities governments associations farmers and other customers to advocate for the safe and responsible use of pesticides coordinating the safe use ambassador program that partners with governments and universities to support students in reaching out to farmers to talk about the safe use of pesticides collaborating with our industry association croplife international for safe use trainings and empty container management particularly in driving the professional crop protection application project as a leader in this industry partnering with universities on the safe use ambassador program in the apac region which fosters the exchange of know-how on best practices in the use of crop protection products by bringing students and farmers together with this we have reached 36 universities in 8 countries in 2020 with more than 10000 students trained as certified bayer safe use ambassadors to date these ambassadors have in turn trained thousands of growers during their farm visits and internships the path ahead for product responsibility as a key focus of our sustainability strategy we will be enhancing our efforts in promoting product responsibility in all the regions we serve in the past few years we’ve already moved from an ad hoc approach to delivering safe use trainings towards a more targeted and coordinated approach that increases overall outreach in 2019 we confirmed over 1 million farmers trained in face-to-face trainings and in 2020 reached more than 1 million farmers with digital trainings when in-person trainings were not available due to health reasons and this number only includes formally confirmed trainings the reach to additional farmers is expected to be much larger we’re continuing efforts to safely hold as many in-person trainings as possible but are particularly ramping up our investment in virtual and digital training to increase our reach while ensuring the quality of training this was especially important during challenging times such as the covid-19 pandemic when food security and safety are even more critical to the health of our society and in-person trainings were more difficult to hold due to social distancing measures moreover the ripple effect of trainings and virtual trainings has continual potential to have exponential reach we’ll especially focus our resources on countries which have less national regulation for safe product use and particularly with smallholder famers learn more about our commitment to empowering smallholder farmers going forward we’ll continue to transparently report annually our progress on trainings and other initiatives that ensure the customers we serve have the necessary information to use our products safely and sustainably

the sixth generation of his family to own and operate the damianshof farm and he takes safe and sustainable use of crop protection seriously “water pollution control is resource protection” states bernd olligs and one of his top priorities is to systematically manage water protection on his farm to ensure absolutely no crop protection residues enter the water to ensure that these residues do not enter the water system when meticulously cleaning his spraying equipment bernd uses an innovative biological system called phytobac® installed on his farm in 2012 it collects water used to clean sprayers and makes use of microorganisms to biologically break down any residues found in the water at damianshof like on all bayer forwardfarms using crop protection products responsibly doesn’t just apply to use in the fields in order to guarantee the comprehensive protection of the farmer as a user and of the general public as consumers bernd only uses seeds and crop protection products that have undergone comprehensive safety testing and registration further innovative solutions such as the closed filling system easyflow® m protects the farmer from direct contact with crop protection products the system facilitates the safe filling and dosing of crop protection products into the application tank as well as in the cleaning of empty canisters it prevents drips or splashes which is

and crop protection solutions to farmers around the world the team which is comprised of more than 16000 company employees plays an important role when it comes to sustainable resource and supply chain management has a strong influence on the entire organization’s day-to-day operations and is the driver for adopting more sustainable practices across bayer our priorities for sustainability in product supply product supply has ambitious sustainability goals which add to the foundation we have built over decades of increasingly sustainable practices for instance in 2019 we exceeded our targets for both water conservation and greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction as we look ahead we are stepping up our efforts in direct support of our company-wide 2030 sustainability commitments and are setting new parameters as we strive to advance a carbon-zero future for agriculture as a global company we have the ability to influence how agriculture and supply chains can leverage technologies and work with our grower customers to transform together were also proud to support water conservation methods both within leading to and delivering out from our fields through automated irrigation systems and other next-generation technology were discovering new avenues to reclaim and recycle water across our research and production facilities in fact two of our hawaiian facilities run exclusively on repurposed water nearly 188 million gallons per day 00:00 due to its size and scope product supply is also the function that generates the greatest co2e or carbon dioxide equivalent across bayer – responsible for the majority of the company’s generated greenhouse gas emissions our production processes are resource-intensive as transforming raw materials into products for agriculture growers requires water energy and more while we continue to develop climate-smart solutions to reduce field greenhouse gas emissions we remain focused on our responsibility to first look inward at our own operations to be leaders in sustainability we are already assuming this responsibility by reducing our footprint and implementing programs that decrease the use of resources in our supply chain and production processes one way we are meeting our commitment to reducing agriculture’s impact on the environment is by using our resources more sustainably and efficiently site teams are working intensely together with global experts on the roadmaps toward 2030 goals analyzing energy flows switching to 100 percent renewable electricity conserving and managing water use reducing materials and energy consumption in our chemical and seeds processes and optimizing our logistics network as the global leader in innovative ag inputs – including crop protection seeds and digital solutions – we have a unique opportunity not only to help farmers make their operations more sustainable and grow more with less but also to transform the whole food value chain to ultimately provide consumers with enough and healthier food without starving the plant we will lead by example by investing in digital tools data technology science and our people to improve our supply chain and operations and provide those innovative solutions for farmers while reducing our energy use and resource consumption our clear roadmap to reach our ghg neutrality commitment by 2030 is an important proof point of this ambition dirk backhaus member of the executive leadership team and head of product supply for the crop science division of bayer leveraging technologies to transform agriculture to make our production processes more sustainable we are leveraging digitalization for more precise process control for example digital technology helps us use up to 60 percent less water compared to traditional methods of irrigation in one of our corn growing sites in argentina we built an integrated water use control program which provides insights into the water conditions through the use of satellite images the program generates reports that allow us to see field-by-field soil water conditions and forecasts that help us make real-time decisions the system today covers 11 sites and 40 seed partner-growers in argentina totaling 16000 hectares through this program we have saved more than one billion gallons of water versus the conventional methods of irrigation – enough savings to supply 30000 people locally with fresh water for one year delivery of products is an important part of our supply chain operations and we use the power of digital technology to improve our logistics networks as well we developed an end-to-end transportation management system that has already lowered our number of necessary trucks on the road and provided more optimal driving routes to customers weve saved 28000 metric tons of co2 emissions from 2016 to 2018 and believe we can scale these efforts and expect to see significantly higher emission savings over the next few years 00:00 collaborating with growers our growers play an important role in achieving our sustainability goals too our ghg emissions and water use guidelines and goals extend to our contract farmers and through the introduction of technology and collaborative partnerships we will continue to help them reduce their footprint in seeds production we test and validate best practices for soil conservation and work with growers based on local agricultural requirements – from rice in india to corn in the united states we collaborate closely with these growers to develop technologies that reduce inputs for their fields water usage for example depends on crop and region and we are far ahead in many areas with water spray technology which has evolved over the years and is now a highly optimized system nearly 90 percent of the physical optimum finally by staying engaged in local communities around the world we continue to progress – from conserving water to reducing waste to educating locals on our positive impacts crop science executive leadership team dr dirk backhaus 1:54 00:00 demonstrating transparency in our impact measurement and reporting for decades bayer has been active in climate

a system approach to a critical crop bayer has more than 50 years of experience working with rice farmers in crop protection providing an effective and integrated weed management system through our arize hybrids which are 40% of the small but growing direct-seeded rice market in india we’ll continue to build on our direct seed rice share – all while improving our offerings through precision breeding to boost yields rounding out our direct seeded rice system is our digital platform farmrise which helps create awareness educate and advise farmers to make better agronomic decisions dsr is also expected to reduce water use by up to 40% reduce co2 emissions by 45% and reduce methane emissions by 85% through broadscale adoption this will go a long way to meeting our goal of improving water use per kilo of crop by 25% in 2030 by transforming the rice cropping system producing more with less: cotton in the us bayer’s top deltapine cotton varieties see a 70 pound of lint per acre advantage versus top-planted competitor varieties it’s important to remember that extra yield is not just a number; it can be clothing that farmers otherwise wouldn’t be able to supply without putting more land into production regenerative agriculture means doing more with less while still providing the yields that customers around the world need the extra yield our top varieties generate means that growers are supplying a cotton equivalent of an additional shirt and pair of jeans for 33 people for each acre they farm transformative traits bayer crop science is the undisputed leader of plant biotechnology over the last 27 years we have launched more than 65 biotech traits – more than any other company – enabling farmers to grow crops like corn soybeans cotton and canola with game-changing capabilities on around 300 million acres annually the value of the product offerings we bring to markets around the world is well recognized by growers because of the combination of these capabilities and our leading germplasm this mix supports greater than 10 billion euros in annual seed and trait sales which includes 26 billion euros from licensing alone through expertise in four key technologies – gene protein rna and genome – bayer replenishes and improves our trait offerings and biotech pipeline; even creating the largest multi-gene stacks for growers covercress - a gene editing success story covercress is a powerful example of the capabilities of biotechnology using multiple gene edits and advanced breeding tools our partner covercress was able to improve the oil profile protein content and yield of field penny cress very quickly these improvements to quality and processing characteristics meant that penny cress was effectively converted from a common weed into a novel cash cover crop with the potential to serve as a low-carbon renewable feed stock for the growing biofuel market cover crops help store carbon in the soil while improving soil health by increasing organic matter and contributing to healthy field microbiomes built-in pest protection last year in the us bayer launched smartstax pro with rnai technology against corn rootworms to fight against corn rootworm with state of the art technology corn rootworm is an insidious pest because as the name suggests it damages roots where it’s hard to see until it’s too late that means that all the inputs growers use from water to fertilizer are not utilized as effectively reducing efficiency for lost yield and profitability small changes in rootworm control can have a large impact in the field in our trials for a 200 bushel per acre field a root injury level that we saw with one of our top competitor’s products could result in a 29 bushel per acre loss traits support and enable regenerative agriculture practices bayer traits don’t just protect yield from insect and weed pressure they enable regenerative agriculture practices; transforming what bayer innovates in our labs into flexibility and options for on-farm success when growers have herbicide tolerant crops they have the flexibility to control weeds without tilling them under reducing soil compaction and topsoil erosion while improving carbon sequestration our herbicide-tolerant crops have enabled no-till and conservation tillage practices by allowing excellent pre-plant and in-season weed control in lieu of deep plowing before planting sustainable small molecules bayer crop science is a leader in global crop protection a position we have earned by innovating new options that help growers address pest disease and weed challenges and by driving our leading crop protection portfolio to sales of more than 13 billion euros in 2022 bayer holds the number one position in herbicides the number two position in fungicides and the number three position in insecticides and we advanced nine new actives in 2022 in a crop protection pipeline with peak sales potential of more than 9 billion euros our innovation approach to crop protection is already allowing us to find the newest generation of crop protection solutions like plenexos; but we are pushing beyond established standards to unlock a new benchmark in the industry for designing the next generation of sustainable crop protection solutions through the cropkey approach to crop protection discovery cropkey - a new crop protection discovery approach for bayer cropkey is an entirely new approach to the discovery of crop protection products which will allow bayer crop science to reach new levels in precision and sustainability while being exceptionally effective with cropkey we are designing molecules based on profile driven discovery this allows us to create solutions based on pre-defined safety and sustainability profiles that go above and beyond current standards and that interact in well-defined prescribed pathways in fact we now have more than 30 potential new molecular targets under investigation in discovery and we’ve validated more than 10 targets as new modes of action in early research all arising from this new cropkey discovery approach two new cropkey modes of action bayer has announced two new modes of action designed using the cropkey approach that are being brought from conception to reality in record time first for fruits and vegetables we have designed a unique broad-spectrum fungicide with a new mode of action and performance above commercial standards now in phase 2 this fungicide shows potential for control of key relevant leaf spot fungi diseases like botrytis anthracnosis and powdery mildew another product of this approach is our previously announced new herbicide molecule which is the first new herbicide mode of action for broadacre post-emergent weed control in 30 years the demonstrated need for crop protection - a growing population the challenges that growers face continue to demonstrate clearly that we must drive flexibility and respond quickly to new pressures in order to continue to feed the earth’s growing population crop protection tools directly ensure farmers can feed the world as crop protection safeguards around 30 percent of yields worldwide – that’s 550 million tons or the equivalent of food for more than 2 billion people bayer’s crop protection products safeguard row crops like corn wheat rice and soy but also fruit and vegetable crops across the world – ensuring that growers can bring nutritious quality products to their customers biological breakthroughs not long-ago biological options were thought of only as microbials but the reality is that the biologicals industry is expanding rapidly in many different directions this includes new kinds of nature-derived biocontrol and biostimulant solutions like pheromone products botanicals and plant extracts and even synthetic biology biologicals offer paths to new solutions such as using synthetic biology to bring nitrogen fixing microbes to corn wheat or rice – food security crops that do not currently fix nitrogen from the air but one day could bayer is already shaping and growing the biologics segment as the preferred r&d development and commercial partner we are positioned to build on our trusted brand regulatory expertise and global commercialization capabilities to bring new products to market more quickly partners who would otherwise only be able to impact thousands of growers alone will be able to reach millions of growers with bayer nitrogen fixation – fertility with reduced greenhouse gases regenerative agriculture is more important than ever and biologicals will be a big part of regenerative ag fertility programs currently agriculture accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has increased global agricultural production by the equivalent of food for over 35 billion people but creating that fertilizer accounts for 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions alone nitrogen fixing technologies offer a potential path forward by reducing the need for carbon-intensive synthetic nitrogen fertilizers while maintaining global food production capacities – the best of both worlds pheromone technology – bayer’s vynyty products regenerative agriculture is more important than ever and biologicals will be a big part of regenerative ag fertility programs currently agriculture accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has increased vynyty citrus is an innovative device - a container with an active liquid inside - that does not encourage residues in harvests or the environment it replicates the mating pheromones of the south african cotonet to attract males of the species who are then killed by the pyrethrin built into the device vynyty press – distributed by bayer through our partnership with m2i – interrupts the mating behavior of target pests to stop them from finding mates and creating larval insects that damage crops they’re a great way for growers of stone and pome fruits like peaches apples and pears as well as tomato and grape growers to integrate biomimicry-based pest controls into their pest management systems biologicals: a market poised to grow quickly bayer expects the overall market for biologicals to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of around 7% more than doubling in size to 30 billion euros by 2035 with bayer’s capabilities open innovation approach and market reach we expect to grow the company’s biological sales with a cagr of 17 percent significantly outgrowing the market over the same period within that rapidly growing market bayer expects our sales of biological products to grow to more than 15 billion euros a more than seven-fold increase versus the company’s 200 million euros sales baseline in 2022 digital and carbon frontiers digital tools and data have been transforming agriculture decades the early promise of analytics and software tools in labs and greenhouses helped us to find genetic markers hidden among millions of bytes of data then new and effective digital tools moved on farm with fieldview and we developed new ways for growers to make decisions about their farm armed with data far beyond what the eye can see but there’s a new frontier being explored right now what started in the labs as a tool to build best-in-class seeds and traits and then grew to the farm where it provided actionable insights is now being transformed again – going beyond the farm and into the value chain agriculture is a complex industry and we’ve all spent the last 20+ years figuring out ways to create and formalize data we’re now in an age of digitization where creating and leveraging useful data to provide advice build confidence and help growers share in the value chain is the name of the game fieldview - a dynamic platform for system solutions bayer’s industry leading climate fieldview platform of digital tools now reaches more than 220 million subscribed acres across 23 countries with the addition of australia fieldview is now live across five continents us fieldview customers have a 9% higher retention rate a 34% higher net promoter score and a 37% higher seeding rate than non-fieldview users where bayer can help growers identify opportunities that are meaningful to their farms they are more likely to stay with bayer products tell their friends about bayer and use more bayer products to support their profitability – effectively increasing bayer’s share of farm orbia -

building a world where hunger and climate change are terms relegated to history books it can be done—and innovations on the farm can help get us there that’s why we’re pursuing new possibilities in agriculture that are helping address some of humanity’s greatest challenges so that everyone can enjoy a more sustainable future farming has always thrived on innovation from the very beginning farmers have sought better ways to nourish themselves their families and their communities this commitment continues today as we continually strive to find more sustainable solutions that can help farmers grow enough for a growing world—all without starving the planet explore our commitments to people and our planet reducing agriculture’s environmental impact we can’t empower farmers without also protecting the planet that’s why we’re finding new ways to help farmers produce enough food without adversely impacting the environment moving forward we will continue to judge our innovations not by their ability to produce more but to produce better and to guide our decisions we’ve made three key commitments as a company to reduce agriculture’s environmental impact by 2030 promoting transparency trust matters at bayer we encourage open dialogue about the innovations that drive sustainable agriculture that includes providing open access to our internal safety studies including all 107 of bayer-owned glyphosate assessments later this year we will also pilot a program inviting scientists journalists and ngos to participate in our preparation for the upcoming eu glyphosate re-registration process keeping plants people and our planet safe we apply strict and consistent safety standards in developing all of our products even when it means exceeding local regulations as such we only sell crop protection products where they also satisfy the regulations of each local regional and national market furthermore in 2012 we unilaterally stopped selling any pesticide regardless of its regulatory approval status that is named by the who as a who acute toxicity class 1 looking ahead we’re always evaluating our market approval process to ensure we deliver safe and effective solutions the right way cultivating success we’re working to provide farmers with greater access to agricultural solutions they need in order to thrive over the next decade we will invest 5 billion euros in new weed management solutions which will empower farmers to implement more sustainable strategies by 2029 this r&d investment will help discover new modes of action develop more tailored integrated weed management iwm practices and enhance partnership with weed scientists around the world to develop customizable solutions to benefit farmers at a local level building more meaningful relationships we’re working with the brightest minds in chemistry biology and data science to develop sustainable solutions for agriculture additionally we invite global experts and

plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us with our food systems coming under pressure from challenges such as climate change biodiversity loss and water availability the world’s ability to meet growing food demand will become more difficult and could lead to an increase in global hunger to mitigate the impact of these challenges the agriculture sector will need to adapt to produce more food fiber and fuel to sustain a growing population while using fewer resources and becoming more resilient thanks to key technological innovations and modern practices over the last several decades farmers can today produce more food and fiber on fewer acres and with fewer nutrient inputs than ever before but looking to the future we must work together to create agricultural systems that help farmers adapt to climate change and run a commercially viable business while at the same time protecting our planet limiting the expansion of farmland and renewing earth’s natural ecosystems the way forward is to radically transform today’s farming systems and switch to regenerative agriculture practices that “produce more with less while restoring more” 1:39 00:00 broadening our sustainability approach with a regenerative focus regenerative agriculture practices can play a key role in transforming global agriculture systems as we face the challenges of climate change and food security today however there is no commonly agreed definition of regenerative agriculture for bayer regenerative agriculture is an outcome-based production model which mainly has improving soil health at its core and strenhening resilience as a key objective other principal aims include mitigating climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon removals maintaining or restoring biodiversity conserving water resources as well as increasing yields and improving the economic and social well-being of farmers and their communities put simply regenerative agriculture aims to increase production with fewer inputs while leaving more of our natural world intact the goal is to allow farmers to benefit from higher yields higher incomes and improved livelihoods and nature to recover and thrive bringing regenerative farming to scale with our systems approach at bayer we’re only at the beginning of the journey toward a sustainable future in farming but we see huge potential to scale up regenerative practices on farms around the world whether big or small as a key point of departure we’re taking a system approach to regenerative agriculture this means we’re increasingly treating each farm as an ecosystem in itself with its unique soil and environmental conditions with this information we can provide farmers with a tailored but comprehensive farm solution combining innovations in seeds and traits crop protection and digital technology with our global reach we’re working with partners around the world to help more farmers adopt regenerative farming practices in the coming years as part of these efforts we’re already offering farmers modular rotational cropping systems for selected crops across different regions of the world that are adaptable to the needs of each farm in addition we have a range of different agriculture innovations available in our portfolio that can serve as key building blocks of any regenerative farming system leading the future of regenerative agriculture we are committed to leading the future of regenerative agriculture by: minimizing the climate footprint of farming reducing the environmental impact of crop protection enabling smallholder farmers improving water use at the same time we’re aiming to deliver net benefits to nature that are measured in terms of better soil health restored biodiversity reduced water use and sequestered carbon and we’re doing so while supporting farmers in their efforts to increase agricultural yields farm productivity and incomes with effective climate adaptation solutions and new sources of revenue what do we mean by an outcome-based approach by aligning and supporting these key principles we can achieve the following benefits 00:00 solutions matched to the conditions of each farm we’re constantly looking for ways to create commercial value for the grower in all aspects of the farm as well as measurable benefits for the environment we see no trade-off between sustainability and growth but in fact see huge potential in generating value for farmers and nature with our agriculture innovations while we are only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of a system approach we believe we have some key offerings in our current solution portfolio that have the potential to shape the regenerative future in agriculture in the coming years short stature corn hybrid wheat direct seeded rice covercresstm next gen breeding tech biotechnology biologicals environmental impact reduction

with an entire system of agriculture solutions as part of our offering in the past we have looked at our solutions as pillars – seeds & traits crop protection and digital technology – but the challenge of modern agriculture underscores the need for us to look at all three not as distinct offerings but as part of one holistic solution by bringing together these platforms which we have under one roof we can deliver agriculture solutions that when combined have the potential to increase agricultural yields create commercial value for farmers and generate positive outcomes for nature for farmers bayer’s system approach aims to create long-term value by helping to future-proof farming operations and make them more climate-resilient it opens new opportunities for farmers to meet future expectations at a time of uncertainty and change for example it can help farmers tap into new sources of revenue such as receiving payments for carbon sequestered and has the potential to help them grow their business in compliance with stringent new climate regulations in addition a digitally-enabled system-wide approach to regenerative agriculture enables traceability in the food chain it helps connect what is happening on the farm to consumers who are demanding and buying food with new expectations

plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us in the last few decades the impact of crop protection on the environment has decreased while yields have steadily increased we help growers produce more with less however with innovative inputs new ways to farm and more precise application we have the opportunity — and responsibility — to continue reducing this impact at bayer we have seen the impact that innovation can bring despite our market leadership bayer’s environmental impact of crop protection is already exceptionally low and we will reduce it further 00:00 agricultural activities always have an impact on the environment each tool that a farmer applies has benefits and can often also have drawbacks and this is generally true for crop protection farmers must strike a balance between the need for tools like crop protection – which enables them to keep meeting the world’s growing agricultural demands while using less land and resources – and potential trade-offs posed by increasing the use of such tools the prerequisite for placing crop protection products on the market is clear proof of efficacy while ensuring no effects on human health and only minimal acceptable impact on the environment crop protection products are highly regulated by governmental authorities bayer consistently seeks to develop and offer crop protection products that have the same or better benefits for farmers while having less impact on the environment to this end bayer adopted a methodology for crop protection environmental impact reduction cp eir and made the commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our crop protection products in detail we will reduce bayer’s global treated area weighted crop protection environmental impact per hectare by 30% by 2030 against a 2014-2018 average baseline sustainable agriculture is the perfect balance between the farmer and respect for the environment in other words by taking care of our environment we as farmers are able to obtain sufficient yields from our crops to make our farm profitable patricio valdenbro hacienda las cardenas spain a data-driven approach to reducing environmental impact of crop protection there is no one-size-fits-all solution in agriculture and what works for one grower may not work for another we will partner with growers in the countries and crops where we can have the greatest impact to optimize their entire integrated crop management approach with our ever-expanding set of tools driven by our innovation pipeline we partner with growers to select crop protection solutions tailored to their farms that both add value and reduce the environmental impact of their operations to achieve our commitment we are: optimizing pesticide volumes required per hectare through tools like: precision application: data-driven tools that ensure that the right amount of crop protection is applied in the right place and at the right time seed treatment: seed-applied crop protection tools can dramatically reduce the volume of chemicals used and potential exposure to wildlife and the environment seeds and traits: crops bred and designed to better fight the pests and diseases that attack them ensuring that less chemical crop protection is needed discovering new and better crop protection solutions that can significantly reduce environmental impact such as: new chemistry: new modes of action with better environmental profiles that deliver the same level of efficacy while reducing potential environmental risk and exposure we can now screen new substances at the early stages of the pipeline for their environmental impact and include this assessment in pipeline advancement decisions biologics: we offer a number of products derived from microbes or based on natural defense mechanisms of organisms that complement and enhance integrated management practices and reduce pest resistance recommending best practices to growers that can improve their sustainability and reduce their environmental impact including: stewardship measures: good agricultural practices such as buffer strips tillage practices cover crops or drift and run-off reducing measures that aim to keep crop protection where it is intended: on the field see this in practice on the bayer forwardfarming network integrated pest management: a holistic and systemic approach to pest management on a seasonal or multi-year timescale 00:00 measuring our impact the commitment to reduce the environmental impact of crop protection is a promise we’re making simply yet ambitiously to everyone measuring it is just as ambitious and not nearly as simple but this is how we’ll all know that we’re keeping that promise and making progress by using state of the art crop protection environmental impact reduction cp eir methodology we add the dimension of a robust science-based tool to help compare the relative environmental impacts of different crop protection tools on a farm moreover it enables us to choose and develop products that have less impact while maintaining grower benefits we’re using the two leading externally developed scientific models—and we’re making how we use them public for the first time in the agriculture industry we are using externally developed consensus models to evaluate the potential global environmental impact of our crop protection portfolio developed by a consortium led by the technical university of denmark dtu and endorsed by the unep/setac life cycle initiative pestlci 20 and usetoxr are the most advanced life-cycle assessment models that can be used to characterize potential environmental impact of crop protection across different countries and different crops these models work together to give us a clear idea of our impact here’s how: pestlci has been developed and established by the technical university of denmark dtu in cooperation with other institutes and organizations since 2006 pestlci estimates the quantity of an active ingredient emitted into the surrounding environment with the application of a crop protection product in the field taking into account all contributing processes usetox® has been developed under the auspices of unep-setac in cooperation with various universities and institutions since 2008 usetox® determines concentrations in the surrounding environment and the potential impact the crop protection products could have on the aquatic ecosystems usetox® is also recommended by the european commission as a model for the analysis of product’s life cycles and environmental footprint as the science of impact assessment evolves we’ll work with the dtu and other experts in the field to expand the capabilities of the current models currently we are focusing on the potential impact on aquatic ecosystems and we plan to enhance the model on soil and pollinators in the future and because these models and the underlying methodology are publicly available we invite the scientific community to check our progress and verify where we stand on our commitments scope of the sustainability target all bayer crop protection product applications in the field globally as reported by third party market data providers are in the scope of our commitment to reduce the environmental impact of crop protection the baseline for our commitment is built on an average of all bayer crop protection products applied in the field globally between 2014-2018 and their respective environmental impact using an average as the baseline accounts for the specifics of agriculture such as seasonality or dependence on climatic conditions to ensure the transparency and credibility of the baseline performance tracking and calculation of cp eir all required data are third party data – including crop protection application data or substance characteristic data we’re looking to independent third-parties to verify our work any credible science is peer-reviewed and vetted—and working to reduce crop protection’s environmental impact is no different in fact with an issue that’s so important to us all it should be possible for anyone to measure the progress bayer is constantly working towards its commitment to help farmers all over the world reduce the environmental impact of crop protection that’s why the technical university of denmark will independently assess environmental impact an external panel of experts will review all results and progress third parties are welcomed to independently perform verification of their own using these

crop science aims to be a leader in sustainable agriculture and has made commitments to reduce field greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact of crop protection these commitments have indirect benefits for biodiversity but do not directly address the main root causes of biodiversity decline such as land use change fragmentation and degradation according to ipbes 2019 to address these bayer is exploring ways to balance crop production and nature conservation while generating value for farmers in collaboration with eth zürich and ifpri bayer has been working towards the identification of measures which balance the conservation of biodiversity and the generation of value for farmers and worked with farmers in several countries to better understand their practices and hindrances please see the full report and the related infographics here there is no one fits all solution to foster biodiversity in the agricultural landscape however the biggest opportunities to better balance production and conservation lie in the modifications of our cropping systems we seek to design cropping systems that not only produce more with less but also become more regenerative in terms of soil health and habitats and more resilient towards climate change to explore and develop corresponding elements for those systems we work along three different pillars: soil health increasing value for growers by improving soil health read more improving soil health can generate value for growers by enabling higher yields lower input costs or even extra income from selling carbon credits due to additional soil carbon sequestration overall growers can increase their profitability and at the same time improve ecosystem services such as groundwater replenishment or nutrient availability in our sustainability field trials in latin america we combined regenerative agricultural practices such as no till cover cropping and crop rotations with our products technologies and innovations and validated the positive outcomes for both: soil health and profitability we are exploring business opportunities in regenerative agriculture and will continue to gain

beneficial insects like pollinators habitats for wild flora and animals that live in and around the crops—and even the genetic diversity of the crops themselves at the same time ensuring a safe and secure food supply involves changing how the natural environment and resources are used—and this has an impact on biodiversity biodiversity loss has increased alarmingly in the past several decades in agriculture land use change including the loss degradation and fragmentation of habitats; deforestation; invasive alien species; and lack of knowledge and awareness are key threats to biodiversity according to the latest ipbes report on biodiversity and ecosystem services more than one million species of plants and animals face extinction driven by human activity as part of bayer’s vision “health for all hunger for none” protecting biodiversity is core to our mission and the path forward for agriculture we aim to achieve a biodiversity positive future for agriculture through modern and innovative tools and practices as well as suitable value capture mechanisms to minimize the inherent impact food fiber and fuel production has on biodiversity this involves redesigning the way we grow certain crops including leveraging the genetic diversity of crops to widen crop rotations and increase their resilience another way we do this is by taking into consideration biodiversity conservation and restoration measures at the farm level including protecting and restoring habitats and forests we believe that sustainable innovations and business models will empower growers to gain value by making a positive contribution to biodiversity and soil health while they increase the resiliencies of their farms at the same time this is why we are committed to working with growers to develop and

grow and thrive for millions of years soil is the foundation for successful harvests that’s why we’re constantly trying to understand and learn from it by openly pursuing research opportunities and new ideas with partners we’re not only trying to improve agriculture’s relationship with soil but provide the resources that will help us build a better future for all just like the air we breathe or the water we drink soil needs to be protected the right soil composition allows roots to perform their function properly roots capture water nutrients and minerals as well as anchor plants in the ground whenever the health of roots is compromised plants are weakened and without fertile soil roots cannot grow at bayer we’re building an innovative approach that brings together tailored solutions to help farmers have better harvests while maintaining soil health biodiversity & soil health commitment helping life thrive on and beyond the farm learn more leaving the soil undisturbed modern farming enables farmers to leave the soil undisturbed and promote soil health practices such as no-till reduced-till and conservation tillage allow farmers to reduce or eliminate plowing a field churning up the soil when soil is broken up and turned over in the tilling process it releases carbon stored in the soil and increases the possibilities that the soil will erode via wind or rain reduced tillage practices allow valuable nutrients and moisture to remain in the soil limit soil erosion reduce water run-off and enable farmers to make better use of rainwater these practices have the potential to decrease the need for irrigation and allow farmers to protect freshwater sources no-till methods can also help sequester carbon in the soil with minimal or zero tillage farmers help prevent greenhouse gases from building up in the atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change another advantage of no-till is that farmers are able to better preserve the ecosystem for earthworms nematodes mites insects fungi bacteria and over 1000 different species of invertebrates as we continue seeking the future of agriculture we’re finding innovative ways to protect farmers’ crops by tapping into the power of organisms already in the ground 00:00 protection all year round cover cropping is another rapidly growing farming practice used to reduce erosion and improve soil health through the practice of cover cropping farmers can grow various plants—like radishes and clover—between growing seasons plants like the tillage radish can provide relief delivering improved erosion protection and increased moisture retention by breaking up the soil legumes like crimson clover use natural soil bacteria to pull nitrogen from the atmosphere and attach it to the legume roots where it can benefit plants in the following year cover crops help keep nutrients and organic matter in the soil making it healthier and more sustainable leading to better harvests rethinking plant nutrients fertilizers continue to be one of the biggest expenses farmers face each year over three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and three percent of natural gas used globally comes from the use and production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers but what if we could harness the natural powers of bacteria in the soil to help plants capture nitrogen from the environment at bayer we’ve partnered with ginkgo bioworks to form joyn bio a joint venture working to create microbes that help crops extract nitrogen from the air and radically reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer together we’re studying the relationship between microbes and plants we’re looking at how these two have evolved and their unique contribution to the ecosystem we hope to enable farmers to reduce

erosion during rainfall and control the growth of weeds in the spring plant remains are left on the soil to secure nutrients slowly releasing them over time and creating more organic matter reduced tillage in the 20th century farmers tilled under crop residue to expose fresh soil and stop weed growth however farmers today are turning to no-till farming and conservation tillage when farmers choose not to plow after harvest organic matter remains in the soil reducing soil erosion and the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere microbials tiny organisms and bacteria have unlocked imaginative leaps in medicine and nutrition—and they might just be key to agriculture as human curiosity drives us to look closer and dig deeper we’re finding innovative ways to protect

forwardfarming transparency crop protection gmo crops plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us combating climate change today agriculture is responsible for nearly a quarter of all global greenhouse gas emissions - but farmers also have an incredible superpower to bring to the fight against those emissions more about agriculture solutions by pioneering solutions that help decarbonize agriculture farms around the world are making a massive positive impact in the fight against climate change while climate change affects us all farmers are especially attuned to the impact of increasingly extreme weather conditions including drought severe heat flooding or other shifting climatic trends together these various challenges make it more difficult for farmers to cultivate their crops ensure their livelihoods and support the global food system we all rely on that’s why bayer is devoted to decarbonizing agriculture by developing new solutions that help farmers withstand the impacts and address the causes of climate change by 2030 bayer has committed to help our farming customers reduce their field greenhouse gas footprint by 30% from contributor to mitigator in agricultures effects on climate change although agriculture is a contributor to climate change the industry also plays an increasingly important role in curbing greenhouse gas ghg emissions that contribute to climate change such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrogen oxide fields planted with cover crops right image above provide additional benefits for farms their crops and net-zero carbon emissions in agriculture farmers are taking steps today to decarbonize agriculture and reduce the effects of climate change and create a more sustainable future in particular cutting-edge tools and farming practices are helping farmers significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas their operations emit while also removing carbon from the atmosphere in fact this is the basis of bayer’s carbon program—an innovative business model that rewards farmers for implementing climate-smart practices in their fields by incentivizing farmers for adopting practices such as no-till or cover crops this initiative is helping farmers across the us earn additional income while pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it in the soil and with pilot programs underway in brazil and across europe the bayer carbon program has the potential to help make a massive positive impact in addressing the challenges of climate change on farms around the world bayer’s carbon program is one of many ways we’re driving innovations to address climate change from farms around the world explore some of the other existing and evolving approaches that are already making a positive impact: reducing tillage better weed-control solutions reduce the need for farmers to till their soil thereby decreasing soil disruption and the amount of tractor passes over the field in addition to curbing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel use this also improves the soil’s natural ability to store carbon nutrients and water for improved crop performance increasing efficiency in agriculture by providing incredibly detailed information about what’s happening in the fields digital tools and precision agriculture techniques are helping farmers streamline their workload conserve resources and much more for example bayer is pioneering new software platforms and monitoring tools that leverage farm data to recommend how a farmer can use fewer pesticides with greater effect which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide runoff into water similarly precipitation alerts tell farmers when conditions may be too wet or windy to apply pesticides helping to avoid costly treatments and unnecessary fossil fuel use from above satellites and drones provide real-time field health images that can help identify areas of crop stress or pest infestations so farmers can take corrective action quickly and efficiently these and other tools are essential in growing enough food on less land offering the potential to reduce the number of acres needed to feed a growing population optimizing nutrients agriculture is also pioneering the use of microbes to enrich crops by helping plants harness and use nutrients and water more efficiently joyn bio a joint venture between bayer and ginkgo bioworks is working to create microbes that will help crops like corn wheat and rice extract nitrogen from the air to use on their own this would radically reduce the need for man-made fertilizer and be a powerful step towards a future with net-zero carbon emissions in agriculture halting deforestation the largest source of atmospheric carbon related to farming occurs when agricultural expansion leads to deforestation or draining of wetlands which reduces the ability of the natural ecosystem to absorb and store carbon by developing solutions that help farmers grow enough on less land agriculture is working to preserve natural habitats—even finding ways to help farmers identify areas of their land that would add more value to their operation as a biodiversity sanctuary to support animals pollinators and their surrounding environment helping farmers manage changes in weather smallholder farmers are particularly dependent on climatic conditions to grow their crops with an increasingly unpredictable climate extreme weather conditions could threaten entire harvests to help bayer is committed to finding innovative ways to empower smallholders with access to tools insights and resources to mitigate these effects so they can cultivate their crops in spite of unprecedented climatic challenges withstanding floods rice is an important staple food for over 35 billion people who rely on approximately 200 million smallholder farmers to grow it yet throughout the mekong delta in vietnam flooding has been a considerable challenge for smallholder farmers to cultivate their crops while meeting growing demand if the rains are late the sea can flood the rice paddies and salinize the soil to help smallholders withstand and overcome these challenges bayer’s “much more rice” program offers a comprehensive solutions program featuring innovative technologies such as hybrid seed that can withstand up to 14 days of being submerged by 2030 rice yields will have to rise by 30 percent—from the same area of arable land—to guarantee food security defying drought wheat farmers in the midwestern united states require about 50 centimeters almost 20 inches of precipitation per year but in some years they only get half of that with drought as a considerable factor recent studies estimate that wheat harvests could decline by 6 percent with every degree of climate warming 60% the demand for wheat will increase by approximately 60 percent by 2050 while many farmers use reduced-tillage methods to maintain moisture in the soil this can also create opportunities for invasive weeds to compete with wheat plants for light nutrients and the very moisture farmers are working to conserve at bayer we’re developing new and more effective crop protection solutions that are helping farmers manage their crops without leaving them vulnerable to additional threats such as weeds insects or disease one challenge with countless solutions climate change is a major challenge but it’s also an opportunity for us to reimagine what we can accomplish through agriculture in addition to developing new solutions to reduce agriculture’s impact on the environment we’re also exploring how to shape agriculture to become part of the solution as we work to accomplish both we’re proud to empower farmers with the tools they need to grow their

sustainably increased smallholder incomes will in turn benefit the inclusive development of low- and middle-income countries d narain global lead smallholder farming smallholder needs many of these smallholder farmers are facing significant challenges their yields are often low because they do not have access to high-quality crops and practical knowledge about more productive and environmentally friendly cultivation methods often they do not have affordable financing opportunities and access to markets on which they can sell their products at appropriate prices at the same time smallholder farmers are also highly exposed to the impacts of climate change and increasingly to harvest losses for all these reasons they are often not able to achieve a stable income through farming smallholder strategy as the world’s leading agriculture company we will support a total of 100 million smallholder farmers in lmics by 2030 by improving their access to agricultural products services and partnerships to achieve this we are increasing the range of our commercial efforts and strategic initiatives tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers our strategy to strenhen smallholder farmers

protecting the environment smallholder farmers are often the first to suffer from adverse effects of climate change any solution to smallholder farmers must therefore consider environmental sustainability and climate change resilience for instance climate-resilient seed varieties or hybrid seeds can further minimize these risks and help smallholder farmers grow their yields in challenging climatic conditions our solutions enable them to maintain and improve soil health as the foundation of a productive and sustainable agriculture and the introduction of innovative growing practices as with directly seeded rice combine economic opportunities for farmers with environmentally sustainable agricultural practices smallholder farmers growing for instance our bean variety moraleda as an intercrop for tomato cultivation are contributing to improve their soil’s health in india beans are commonly eaten around the world and are a rich source of fiber and b vitamins as well as plant-based protein in addition to the benefits for human health bean cultivation has a potential positive impact on soil health through fixation of nitrogen levels in the soil which is crucial for plant and crop health in many parts of india farmers previously used local cucurbits and gourds as an intercrop but were struggling due to lower yields virus incidents and a lack of market interest with a better understanding of the benefits of intercropping with leguminous crops many tomato and grape farmers began to implement the practices by replacing cucurbits and gourd crops with moraleda

of our products during use transport storage and disposal the correct use of protective clothing and first aid measures in the event of emergencies our objective is to continuously increase the outreach of our safe-use training activities in 2022 we trained 27m smallholder farmers on the safe use of our crop protection products an experimental study with a sample group of 270 smallholder farmers in india conducted by banaras hindu university india confirms increased awareness and high adoption of responsible use practices by farmers after bayer’s safe use training more than half of the farmers interviewed pre- and post-training confirmed the development of a technical skill set with preference for gaining more practice their attitude towards safe use has positively changed with training adoption rates of >80% three quarters mention an increased quality of farming because of the training and around 80% confirm they now feel much more comfortable doing their farm work and

in varanasi up/india; august 2023; based on pre- and post-training surveys with 360 smallholder farmers in december 2022/january 2023 and 270 in june/july 2023 reducing food loss on and beyond the farm in india it is estimated that 20 to 50% of food produced is lost post-harvest the majority of the well over 100 million tons of perishable food produced is transported in unrefrigerated vehicles – in a hot climate the typical three-day refrigerated journey from harvest to supermarket in spain for example can easily be a seven-day unrefrigerated journey in india as much as 40% of the tomatoes grown in india are lost before they can be sold - a significant loss of nutritional food as well as income for smallholder farmers determined to tackle this problem a team of scientists and breeders from bayer identified two key factors: shelf life and firmness the newly commercialized bayer varieties have a 12-to-14-day shelf life compared to the typical 5-to-7-day timeframe they also deliver superior fruit quality firmness and disease resistance as well as greater adaptability for producing more in the hot summer months for example a case study by wageningen university reveals that only about 8-10% of the bayer variety ansal® produce was estimated to be lost in the post-harvest chain versus estimated loss of 20-25% for a leading competitor variety for india resulting in approximately 23% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per kg of marketable crop1 bayer’s vegetable seeds portfolio aims to provide farmers with seed varieties that help minimize food loss at both the pre-harvest and post-harvest stages 1 based on product performance data from 2013-2017 from 65 bayer internal trials and post-harvest data from 60 growers and 10 dealers and exporters for the south and west india

access to healthcare closer to communities based on its reach into remote rural areas access to healthcare facilities can prove to be a challenge with some smallholder farmers being as far as 15 hours away additionally the family planning participation rate in these communities is relatively low while the prevalence of stunting is high in addition to agricultural offerings the local better life farming agri-entrepreneurs together with our local teams and ngo partners distributed contraceptive products as well as samples of immune vitamins and offered general and prenatal nutrition education through the nutrient gap initiative we have reached roughly 800000 smallholder farmers and their families combining the efforts across our crop science consumer health and pharmaceuticals divisions we have also trained around 44000 female farmers and farmers’ wives on family planning self-care and stunting prevention with promising outcomes in terms of knowledge adoption1 on average 97% of participants said that self-care is important when asked about what they knew about self-care their level of knowledge increased by 15% when asked about stunting 72% of participants were knowledgeable versus 67% before start of the program most participants associated family planning with the number of children; this was indicated by how they defined family planning as ‘having two children is enough’ after the seminars more participants defined family planning as ‘forming a healthy and prosperous family’ we will pilot the expansion of services offered with access to nutritional solutions

forwardfarming transparency crop protection gmo crops plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us by 2050 global agriculture must grow enough food for almost ten billion people while using fewer natural resources in addition to finding new ways to satisfy this demand by growing enough farmers and plant scientists are also reimagining what agriculture can accomplish by helping humanity reduce food loss and waste 33% of all food produced in the world is lost or wasted every year before people consume it food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao food loss & food waste: two sides of a similar challenge food loss and food waste both represent important opportunities for us to improve how we nourish our growing world but they aren’t quite the same thing food loss typically refers to food that is spilled spoiled or damaged during growing storage processing or distribution this of course includes crops that are lost on the farm due to environmental stress inefficient machinery or limitations of technology food waste describes when food isn’t consumed often because it is forgotten or discarded though food waste occurs at the retail level in local markets and grocery stores it’s also a result of consumer behavior regardless of how food loss and waste occurs there are many opportunities to improve how we grow transport and consume food agricultural experts from crop scientists to logistics engineers are working together to pioneer new approaches to make a global impact across the board tackling food loss starts on the farm every seed in a farmer’s field has the potential to grow crops but if a plant fails that opportunity is wasted with challenges like insects diseases and climate change farmers need solutions that are specifically developed to withstand these various pressures to have healthy harvests digital farming technologies such as soil sensors and satellites are helping to preemptively diagnose and treat various threats to crops before they take hold—helping prevent crop loss from the start in addition farmers are utilizing genetically modified and hybrid seeds along with chemical and biological crop protection tools to protect their crops’ potential better handling during the food journey there are many steps in the food journey from the farm to consumers the first is harvesting which can damage crops if done improperly reducing growth capacity or shelf life similarly loss can also occur if there are interruptions or mistakes as foods are washed peeled sliced or boiled with improved seed technology and precise harvesting equipment agriculture is making continuous improvements to help more crops make it off the farm farming is also benefiting from re-envisioning the supply chain cooling down the temperature in storage silos and in shipping containers helps keep foods fresh and free of pests given that roughly 50 percent of fruits vegetables roots and tubers are lost before reaching consumers these seemingly small improvements are making a massive positive impact additionally at bayer we are addressing food loss well before harvest by applying data analytics and gps tracking technologies to improve shipping routes to reduce transit times for seed shipments this not only reduces fuel consumption and carbon emissions but also enables farmers to sow seeds at the perfect moment in the season so they can make the most of their acreage and optimize productivity 40% of food losses in developing countries occur post-harvest and during processing while 40% of losses in industrialized countries occur at retail or consumer levels extending shelf life and improving food quality bayer is also looking inward to prolong shelf life using a combination of traditional breeding techniques plant breeding innovations such as genome editing and biotechnology our plant scientists are developing new plant varieties that grow and travel better with greater resistance to pests and diseases more efficient nutrient absorption and improved textures these new varieties better withstand harvest and distribution—so that markets and grocery stores have enough quality food for consumers to choose from this increased shelf life also gives consumers a larger window in which to enjoy their food before it spoils innovation in the fight against food loss in our efforts to find new ways to farm better one approach is to help farmers grow better crops to do so scientists are researching how to harness the capabilities of genome editing tools such as crispr—a technology that can alter the genetic makeup of an organism to improve its characteristics in agriculture genome editing has the potential to be used to help plants keep themselves healthy through self-immunization against diseases and increase yield by giving plants the capacity to more efficiently meet their own needs farmers are able to spend less time on the tractor use fewer natural resources and inputs beyond the field this technology also has the potential to allow us to develop produce that doesn’t brown bruises less and resists damage during shipment reducing food waste: everyone can help when it comes to building a better world the agriculture sector cannot accomplish it alone though we are reimagining ways for farming to do more for people and our planet everyone shares a stake in reducing food waste even something as simple as buying produce that doesn’t look entirely perfect can make a big difference in our collective ability to nourish ourselves and take better care of our planet by not taking more than we need we leave enough for others and reduce the pressure to store excess food beyond their respective shelf lives when we work together

nutritious food however today the un estimates that there are already 800 million people who do not have access to enough food coupled with climate variability and evolving pest and disease pressures we know that maintaining the status quo in agriculture and the food value chain is not enough we have the opportunity and the responsibility to grasp this moment and to help move humanity forward by working together in a multi-stakeholder environment to shape a food system that is better for farmers consumers and the planet by the numbers 4 people per second are born every day 10 billion people will live on earth by 2050 70% increase in food production to support the population by 2050 fulfilling this vision—now and in the decades to come—will not be a simple task but we’re devoted together with our partners to sharing knowledge and to innovating so that the future of agriculture can flourish to satisfy a growing population in a safe and sustainable way will require bayer to fundamentally re-imagine what it means to be an agriculture company fortunately we have a blueprint to guide us when population growth raised concerns of a global famine in the 1960s dr norman borlaug led the green revolution by introducing modern agricultural practices to developing countries—saving an estimated one billion people from starvation fifty years later we know that further innovation is crucial for addressing agriculture’s challenges making better use of our land most of the world’s suitable farmland is already being used populations are growing and need land to live and work while agriculture faces the challenge of not only growing enough in the next 30 years but doing so on less land than it uses today this means that we need to make better use of the land that we do have while ensuring that we safeguard biodiversity and our natural resources by improving the ability of farmers to produce a successful crop we are helping to ensure a consistent nutritious and stable food supply for communities around the world we are developing seeds that can thrive even in adverse or unpredictable environmental conditions which can enhance farmers’ abilities to successfully cultivate crops despite droughts flooding or increased pest pressures brought about by climate change one way this comes to life is through our collaborative work in sub-saharan africa on water efficient maize for africa wema wema is a multi-stakeholder partnership aimed at improving food security and livelihoods among smallholder farmers in sub-saharan africa by combating the impacts of droughts and insects on maize crops which is the main source of food for more than 300 million africans bayer’s contributions include providing the drought-tolerant and insect-resistance traits on a royalty-free basis together with research and technical expertise for the wema partnership to develop and deploy locally adapted maize hybrids for all seed companies in africa to sell to smallholder farmers another great innovation in seed technology is arize a first-of-its-kind hybrid rice seed which we launched in 2018 in india arize has been bred with resistance against brown plant hopper and bacterial leaf blight diseases which both cause huge crop losses another arize rice variety that can survive more than 15 days under a sustained flood was introduced in bangladesh where frequent flooding has a serious impact on farmers’ rice harvests learn more about our innovative work in seeds and traits the big promise of supporting smallholders our challenges are global—and we can’t solve them unless we think inclusively this is particularly true in regard to supporting smallholder farmers despite producing roughly 80% of the food in developing countries most have historically been unable to use or access the advanced tools and technologies that are more widely available to farmers in other parts of the world bayer’s food security initiatives are critical and collaborations to sustainably improve the lives of smallholder farmers are at the heart of our work in agriculture by creating solutions that work within unique local climates and context we can support smallholders to increase their productivity to feed their families nourish their communities and protect our planet we are creating digital tools that can diagnose crop pests lend agronomic advice or even help sell harvests at a fair market price—all within a single smartphone and in communities around the world together with partners such as non-governmental and international development organizations we’re advancing initiatives that will contribute to food security our collaboration with solidaridad one of the most globally recognized international ngos working to integrate smallholder farmers into sustainable agricultural value chains is connecting thousands of smallholder sugarcane farmers to mills in mexico and central america by providing these farmers with access to knowledge technology and innovation complemented by trainings in good agricultural practices and environmental stewardship we are helping to set the foundation for improved livelihoods food security integrated landscape management and climate change resilience with the inter-american institute for cooperation on agriculture iica one of the most prominent and reputable multilateral agricultural development organizations in latin america our partnership agreement focuses on among other areas some of the key elements of food security: empowering small-scale producers promoting good agricultural practices through demonstration plots fostering youth leadership more specifically iica is hosting our online baygap service program on their e-learning platform opening access to the power of knowledge for potentially millions of smallholder farmers across the continent baygap is a series of modules developed by bayer to enable producers to implement a sustainable model that provides socio-economic benefits guarantees the safety and quality of production and generates opportunities to access markets iica is also supporting the next generation of farmers to prepare for their contribution to food security by providing mentoring to delegates of the bayer youth ag summit together our food security initiatives are helping smallholders approach the unique challenges and opportunities of their unique environment and to sustainably cultivate their crops 00:00 improving access to quality nutritious foods to build a healthier future for all we need to think beyond increasing simply humanity’s access to calories but also to improving access to enough quality and nutritious foods today most types of fruits and vegetables come in dozens or even thousands of different varieties with the ability to resist specific threats like disease or to thrive in a certain climate eg cooler temperatures with a short growing season or hot and prone to drought conditions learn more about our innovations in plant breeding in addition to plant breeding technologies we also work with stakeholders across the entire food chain through our food chain partnership program this innovative collaboration model brings together farmers food exporters and importers processors and retailers to work on tailored crop solutions that range from enhancing product quality and harvests to improving the traceability of food learn more about the food chain partnership a global roundtable food security is one of the crucial challenges defining the 21st century—one that will require everyone to do their part to find new ways to push past the impossible we all share a stake in building a better food system from farmers who are using innovative new tools to cultivate more successful crops in sustainable ways to consumers making informed choices about how we nourish our bodies many of the tools and technologies we will need in the future have yet to be invented so we’re also building

podcast contact us improving food security is more than growing enough food for a growing world it demands trust in the safety and quality of the food as well our commitment raising the bar in transparency trust in our food system starts with understanding where our food comes from and how it is grown ultimately this means there must be transparency and accountability along the food journey our new standard is to not only give access to studies about our products but also show how they are conducted by enabling access to study results in addition to background materials we hope to foster an open science-based dialogue on our products learn more about bayer’s commitment to transparency 00:00 protecting the food supply food safety and pesticides pesticide is a broad term used to describe insecticide herbicide and fungicide crop protection tools used by modern and organic farmers alike they serve as an important tool for farmers to protect crops reduce waste and ultimately help ensure an adequate supply of food this also means that pesticides are part of the food journey; thus trace amounts of pesticides can sometimes be found on foods however the residual levels are incredibly small and are usually well below established safety standards pesticides give it a minute 1:20 00:00 when it comes to pesticide residues regulatory authorities have strict rules in fact the us environmental protection agency epa and the european food safety authority efsa set daily exposure limits at least 100 times below those shown to have no negative effect in safety studies regulatory authorities then monitor foods to ensure residue levels stay below the legal limits for example in september 2019 the us food and drug administration fda published the results of its annual pesticide residue monitoring program and found that “generally levels of pesticide chemical residues measured by the fda are below epa’s tolerances and therefore at levels that are not concerning for public health” in addition to the comprehensive assessments and strict oversight by regulatory authorities bayer does rigorous safety testing well before a product makes it to farmers’ fields even after a product is introduced to the market we continue to test and reaffirm the safe use of a product safety testing of crop protection products can be a long process we do years of testing when developing a product and before it is submitted to regulatory authorities for evaluation and approval on average this process takes over a decade – ensuring all safety questions are addressed during this time when companies conduct the studies for pesticide regulatory submissions the studies are carried out according to internationally recognized quality standards called good laboratory practices glp which provide a framework for how laboratory studies are planned performed monitored recorded audited and archived glp standards are considered among the highest standard of scientific testing in the world these strict compliance guidelines ensure the quality and integrity of the data that are submitted for regulatory review among other things the glp program ensures studies submitted for review contain all the raw data—even if findings are unfavorable to a company’s interest data may not be omitted types of questions addressed during safety testing process: 1 consider all possible scenarios for people coming into contact with a product how could people come in contact with it for example we consider scenarios for people ingesting it breathing it in or spilling it on their skin how much we consider whether someone would be exposed to a large dose or a small dose in different scenarios for how long we look at the scenarios for a one-time accident as well as a lifetime of exposure 2 consider critical aspects to human health are there specific effects on different organs we look at specific potential effects on all organ systems such as the body’s reproductive organs gastrointestinal and nervous systems resulting from periodic exposure as well as any long-term risks such as cancer would any effects be passed down we examine potential effects on pregnancy and development over multiple generations 3 laboratory testing and simulation testing what do simulations tell us we run selected chemicals through computer models many designed for pharmaceuticals to understand how the chemical will react in the body what does testing tell us finally we complete more than 100 human and environmental safety tests required by law to register a chemical for use by farmers and consumers holding ourselves accountable to strict standards protecting human health and the environment as consumers ourselves the safety of our products is paramount and something deeply engrained in our culture safety is the foundation for every scientist in our organization as they are testing and evaluating our products our scientists know that bayer as a company will always support them — and that if they feel uncomfortable with some safety aspects we will address it with bayer it is the strongest part of our values and our culture to ensure that the products we put on the market are safe dana sargent head of regulatory toxicology crop science a division of bayer this commitment to safety extends beyond our crop protection products we approach other products like gmos with the same fervor we strive to set internal standards that not only meet the requirements set by the regulating bodies around the globe but often exceed them this includes safety regarding human health as well as the impact on the environment our long-term success as a company lies in providing farmers with the best tools and solutions so they can grow enough with less environmental impact we are also committed to working with growers and the food supply chain through our food chain partnership program to ensure the proper use of pesticides to deliver safe quality food to

stakeholders alike they share the belief that economic and ecologic sustainability are inseparable in agriculture and that strong partnerships add value to their efforts to produce enough high-quality food while at the same time preserving farmland biodiversity and natural resources such as water and soil each forwardfarm is unique in the crops it grows the land it farms and the community it serves but the farmers share a passion for advancing sustainable and modern agriculture 00:00 the forwardfarming know-how bayer forwardfarming provides an up-close look at how farmers are practicing modern and climate-smart sustainable agriculture around the world unique in its global reach the bayer forwardfarming network serves as platform for knowledge sharing and dialogue forwardfarmers deploy technologies and best practices to improve productivity reduce agriculture-related greenhouse gas emissions decrease the environmental impact of crop protection promote biodiversity and conserve natural resources on the forwardfarms progress towards the crop science sustainability commitments truly comes to life farming with care bayer forwardfarming demonstrates solutions that support sustainability in agriculture across the following three components: 1 care for crops every farm is different and every field within a successful farming operation is unique tailored solutions are needed to meet the needs of the individual farmer and their specific field – from the right seeds and traits to the correct type and amount of crop protection to the digital tools and services that allow for good decision making and precision learn more about tailored solutions learn more seeds & traits with the availability of thousands of varieties of seed and many other important variables to consider selecting the right seed for a field is one of the most important decisions a farmer can make learn more about seeds & traits crop protection products chemical and biological crop protection products combine to protect against weeds pests and diseases other measures and decision support tools help to optimize the applications and allow farmers to apply only as much as is truly needed learn more about crop protection digital tools & services from advanced weather monitoring to satellite remote sensing digital technology enables farmers to take advantage of the data at their fingertips data science transforms traditional practices into an integrated system focused on sustainable use real-time data drives the precise application of resources and state-of-the-art software allows for quick easy analysis of crop management and protection learn more about digital tools 2 care for the planet and people bayer forwardfarming promotes and demonstrates proactive stewardship to protect human health and preserve the environment examples include addressing the safe and responsible use of crop protection products; soil health biodiversity and water conservation; and offering training in all of these areas learn more safe use of crop protection products ensuring the responsible handling and application of products is an essential part of farming safety forwardfarming serves as a demonstration and knowledge exchange for farmers and other stakeholders to share learn and adopt best practices to keep themselves safe and continue to produce enough food for farmer support bayer provides an online tool called bayer dresscode with information about personal protection bayer has also developed a new closed system device called easyflow this device allows operators to measure and translocate crop protection products without being exposed to them enhancement of natural habitat on each farm coexistence with the natural surroundings is important not only for the environment but for the health of the crops depending on the local habitat and species farms implement diverse features including: mixed plant hedges act as a windshield for fruit crops and help prevent spray drift flowering strips and mixed hedges ensure that bees wild pollinators and other beneficial insects have food and shelter throughout the year when active nesting boxes are provided for small birds and resting places for predatory birds insect hotels provide habitat and encourage activity especially by wild pollinators open plots allow skylarks to land and build their nests in the surrounding fields water protection and conservation water is one of our most valuable resources regardless of the activity using and preserving water in a responsible manner is in the farmer’s and the environment’s best interest one example is the phytobac® system used on forwardfarms to ensure safe disposal and cleaning of wastewater residue water collected from a designated cleaning area is distributed slowly over a basin filled with a soil and straw mixture microorganisms in the soil remove chemical residue and the clean water evaporates learn more about water conservation learn more about water quality and phytobac® 3 care for partnerships bayer fowardfarming fosters partnerships with value chain actors research centers universities and other institutions to strenhen sustainable farming development just a few examples of partnerships established by current forwardfarms include: university of gent belgium internet of food & farming 2020 netherlands fraunhofer chile research chile stiftung rheinische kulturlandschaft germany de ruiter experience center netherlands learn more about our collaborations partnerships are the foundation of forwardfarming 3:02 00:00 wherever i have traveled in the world i have always found farmers who try to make their agricultural operations as sustainable as possible and i can say i am happy that with my work i can support them and their families for a better futurethe bayer forwardfarming network is a tremendous platform to experience sustainable farming practices helping to tackle new and ongoing challenges to feed the growing

so they can grow enough with less environmental impact at bayer we are driven by our purpose of science for a better life — and to successfully meet this purpose we need to grow better for our planet and its people agriculture needs the direct and indirect help of countless organisms which help create healthy thriving ecosystems biodiversity — or the variety of different species of plants and animals found in a particular environment — and agriculture are intimately intertwined without the help of many of these organisms a farmer’s crops would not have the resources and support they need to grow of course what we do in agriculture has a measurable impact on the organisms in the growing areas and the surrounding ecosystems that is one of the reasons we’re working to find ways to minimize and even reverse agriculture’s impact 00:00 biodiversity creates opportunity for all biodiversity isn’t just a goal; it’s an asset to our planet all parts of an ecosystem—animals plants microbes and humans—are interconnected in order for our planet thrive we need to not only find ways to meet increasing demands for better harvests but to do so in a way that also protects healthy ecosystems and the many organisms that inhabit them at bayer we’re working to improve upon even our best ideas to: steward and pioneer innovative solutions that empower farmers to farm better like advanced digital tools plant breeding biotechnology and other technologies that that help improve land use to grow enough food while using fewer resources and preserving space for natural ecosystems protect habitats alongside farmers and external partners by avoiding deforestation and supporting reforestation efforts around the world support sustainable farming practices such as integrated weed management cover crops conservation tillage crop rotation and other methods that help farmers conserve natural resources maintain natural habitat and protect the environment maintain rigorous standards in environmental safety testing risk assessment and transparency to produce solutions that minimize agricultures effect on biodiversity collaborate with others within and outside of our industry to pursue new ideas that foster compatibility between agriculture and all organisms habitats keeping habitats healthy it’s a big and beautiful world let’s keep it that way learn more there’s a lot of work to do biodiversity loss is a critical problem the most recent report from the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity & ecosystem services ipbes attributes biodiversity loss to a variety of factors such climate change urbanization pollution and other land-use changes to list a few agriculture has a palpable impact on biodiversity and it’s on us to find ways to mitigate this impact with the right innovations to drive humanity forward farming—and our food system at large—can be part of the solution to help all life on this planet thrive we’ve made great progress but there’s much yet to accomplish that’s why we’re hard at work to create new solutions in agriculture to reverse biodiversity loss around the globe—like digital tools that help farmers identify and transform underperforming areas of their field into wildlife habitat or custom breeding programs that help plants better protect themselves against invasive species there’s no end to what humanity can accomplish and we’re proud to put our ingenuity forward to benefit everyone pollinators partnering with our pollinators humans aren’t the only ones working the fields learn more discover

chain issues and you’ve got as much potential for stress as you do for success that’s exactly why we’re innovating crop protection solutions that meet your needs today – and anticipate what you may need tomorrow just as no two fingerprints are alike no farmer or their fields are either from indiana to india from corn to cauliflower we understand that your challenges and needs are unique to you and your farm – and that means developing crop protection solutions that are personalized down to the individual hectares that make up your operation 00:00 keep reading to discover some of the uniquely-you solutions that are delivering a big impact for farmers around the world – wherever they may be and whatever they may be facing digital weed management combating weeds without combing through fields physically inspecting every hectare or acre of your farm for potential problems is neither realistic nor cost-effective with this in mind it’s easy to see why data-driven digital tools have become a vital part of monitoring crops for a variety of issues before they impact food production these tools integrate with equipment you’re already using to give a range of analyses – from an individual plant to entire farming operations /// turning data into insights on your farm – on any farm – outcomes are everything with the help of digital platforms like climate fieldviewtm and sentera combined with local expertise farmers are able to collect store and analyze valuable data utilizing existing tools and equipment with sentera us farmers work with agronomic partners to monitor pests and risk of crop damage by combining drone imagery with data science gaining valuable insights that help drive optimized real-time crop protection decisions sentera can deliver detailed exact snapshots of weed pressure and location for streamlined scouting and application precise inputs improved outcomes win win 00:00 drone-based applications easing labor pressures in the pacific if you’re like most farmers drones were not-so-long-ago considered futuristic farming tech now though they’re just another tool in the crop protection toolbox in the asia-pacific apac region especially for smallholder farmers drones have become a vital operational asset climate change and covid-19 have severely affected the value chain and labor markets in apac and drones are being used to identify and target specific problem areas within crops – saving farmers vital time and resources ultimately increasing profitability and sustainability /// and they’re safer too as a farmer you know that safety is always top of mind in rice paddies where backpack applications often put farmers directly in the application zone drones have been adopted as a tool to drastically improve input regulation but also to increase safety drones offer farmers the ability to break through broadleaf crop canopies to apply protectants or individual plant applications all from a safe distance with greater precision anticipating crop disease helping farmers predict the unpredictable going into any growing season you’re likely met with hope excitement – and a little bit of uncertainty one of the most unpredictable problems for farmers the world over is disease but what if the unpredictable were…predictable through a new pilot program aimed at cereal farmers we’re hoping to do just that predima predictive disease management utilizes data-driven insight and climatory indicators to predict disease issues before they strike saving farmers time money and stress /// piloting predima in europe surely more certainty from planting to post-harvest would be a welcome addition to any farmer with predima our goal is to develop a program to help farmers like you manage risk better combat disease increase quality and maximize yield more specifically predima provides services like pre-season consultations in-season risk assessments and recommendations as well as a risk-sharing component we’re finetuning

when successful new wheat varieties were made available in countries across the globe 00:00 1974 1974 original single active ingredient roundup® herbicide released a new herbicide using glyphosate as the active ingredient was developed the glyphosate-based herbicide is used by farmers around the world to control weeds in their crops roundup® branded glyphosate-based herbicides also made their way into lawn and garden products which allow landowners to control weeds along sidewalks driveways gardens and fences 00:00 1975 1975 rotary combines are introduced the first twin-rotor system combine was created by sperry-new holland this allowed crops to be cut and separated in one pass over the field for corn it not only separated the husk and ears but also shelled the kernels and chopped the stalks saving considerable amounts of time energy and resources for farmers 00:00 1982 1982 first genetically modified plant cell scientists working at monsanto company became the first in the world to genetically modify a plant cell the team used agrobacterium to introduce a new gene into the petunia plant and announced their achievement the following year within five years these researchers planted their first outdoor trials of a genetically modified crop – tomatoes that were resistant to insects viruses and crop protection solutions the agrobacterium method first used in 1982 is still in use today by bayer scientists as well as those working throughout the entire agricultural industry 00:00 1994 1994 satellite technology advances farming for the first time farmers were able to use satellite technology to see their farms from overhead this new perspective enabled them to collect unprecedented insights to better track their fields performance and strategically plan for next season based on their farm’s data 00:00 1996 1996 the first gmo crops become commercially available after years of testing for safety and performance the first genetically modified row crops became available for farmers in addition to developing cotton that could better protect itself against damaging insects the newly introduced soybeans were developed alongside crop protection solutions that enabled farmers to specifically target invasive weeds that compete with the crop for land water sunlight and soil nutrients 00:00 2000s 2000s software and mobile devices help farmers have better harvests like many people farmers around the world started carrying mobile devices which allowed them to stay connected to colleagues while in the field this also meant they now had access to data while on-the-go in addition to the unprecedented ability to order seed or fertilizer at any time or in any place this also allowed smallholder farmers to access crucial agronomic advice and secure fair market pricing to help protect their livelihoods drones robots and intelligent tractors following the launch of gps technology in the mid- 1990s major farm equipment manufacturers introduced auto-steer capabilities and other automated functions in tractors sprayers and combines which saw widespread farmer adoption ground-based and unmanned aerial vehicles drones were piloted on farms in the early 2000s initially used for crop mapping and in recent years crop scouting seeding and spraying together these technologies helped farmers reach new levels of precision and efficiency in crop management – down to the square meter today drones are used by both large scale and smallholder farmers all over the globe 00:00 2010s 2010s data revolutionizes farming potential through access to real-time data farmers can make better-informed decisions that allow them to use resources more sustainably fieldview™ is a digital platform that combines data from on-farm practices and agronomic models with local weather and soil conditions to provide farmers a more detailed understanding of their fields this enables better harvests while simultaneously benefiting our planet today farmers use fieldview to record their sustainable farming practices and even track the amount of carbon they store in their soil—a critical step in fighting climate change plant breeding 20 mankind has been breeding food crops for thousands of years but by using new understanding of a crop’s genome modern techniques such as marker-assisted selection data science and predictive analytics plant breeders could do their jobs more efficiently than ever before this process called precision breeding has delivered crops with greater yield potential and more resilience in face of evolving pressures from pests weeds diseases and adverse weather for example short-stature corn was developed to stand at the ideal height to avoid greensnap and pair perfectly with combine equipment during harvest that’s a huge step forward in preventing food loss in the field 00:00 2012 2012 crispr technology opens the door to genome editing in 2012 two researchers jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier made a breakthrough nobel prize-winning discovery called crispr – clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats this technology harnesses natural cellular mechanisms for dna repair and enables scientists to “fine tune” an organism’s genome by “turning off or on” characteristics of interest today this technology – known as genome editing – is being used by plant scientists to precisely design seeds with increasingly desirable characteristics such as improved yield or quality profiles resistance to diseases and pests and even climate resilience 00:00 2020s 2020s ai machine learning and digital modeling revolutionize agriculture advancements in data analytics have enabled researchers to make incredible strides toward building a more productive—and resilient—global food system these digital tools are helping unlock entirely new possibilities in crop protection plant breeding and more - the applications of these technologies are endless for example rather than screening hundreds of thousands of leads to find the next great crop protection molecule bayer scientists can now design whole new ones with specific performance safety and sustainability profiles this sea change in small molecule discovery is yielding major results including the discovery of the first new herbicide mode of action in 30 years the cloud connects the world in addition to unlocking innovation within agriculture advancements in cloud computing and data management solutions can connect sustainable practices on the farm with the food feed fiber and fuel value chains and create greater transparency for consumers who want to know where their products come from bayer and microsoft entered into a strategic partnership to advance new solutions that address this growing societal demand and support sustainable sourcing manufacturing and supply chain improvement as well as esg monitoring and measurement rise of the omics “omics” is a collection of tools that enables in-depth study of systems in crop science we use these tools to understand how complex biological systems work - genomics genetic codes transcriptomics genetic expression proteomics proteins and metabolomics small molecules – and create breakthrough innovations that address equally complex challenges for example bayer researchers used “omics” to create the first-ever rna-interference-based solution for a major food crop: a novel biotechnology trait for corn to control the “billion-dollar bug” – corn rootworm 00:00 the future the future sustainable farming in new places and spaces around the world farmers are exploring the potential of farming in new spaces including urban rooftops indoor growing systems and in previously unfarmable places like deserts in addition to insulating crops from environmental pressures such as pests disease and extreme weather events indoor farms allow farmers to grow using considerably less land and far fewer resources similar closed-loop systems are being piloted in the desert such as our marana greenhouse in cities and even the stratosphere rooftop farms provide opportunities for more localized food production reducing air temperatures and improving air quality in urban areas these are all examples of the sort of fundamental advancements necessary to drive a more sustainable future on earth 00:00 driving new possibilities for agriculture agriculture has come a long way—and there’s much more on the horizon that’s because many of humanity’s most important challenges dont yet have a solution by finding new ways to apply new technologies to agricultures most pressing needs we’re finding the answers to tomorrow’s questions and advancing the future of agriculture and with every step forward we’re collectively marking the next milestones

podcast contact us before covid-19 the food supply chain we relied on was a long one trillions of dollars worth of food criss-crossed oceans and highways at the speed of our appetites and it worked for many our staples were made available where and when we wanted them but with the global pandemic that chain was rattled we all saw images of farmers forced to destroy their harvests while lines at food banks grew longer grocery store shelves went bare and food prices went up many factors contributed to the disconnect for one our pandemic-era consumption has changed where we buy our food therefore changing what we eat because crops and livestock are produced processed packaged and shipped in very specific ways to meet very specific demands our changing buying habits meant some food intended for schools and restaurants couldn’t be sold suppliers had to reroute food rapidly and while tons of waste was avoided thanks to fast action and digital insights some harvests were left in fields to rot 00:00 we also have to remember that much of our food comes from very far away our globalized system brings people fresh meat and produce year round and allows for access to food that simply wouldn’t grow locally for example bananas struggle to grow in canada yet currently canadians eat 3 billion of them a year our global system has its advantages under normal circumstances but these aren’t normal circumstances when the pandemic hit borders closed plane train truck and boat shipments were stopped mid-transit and food couldn’t get where it was intended to go when as much as 80% of the food consumed around the world is imported from other countries closed borders are more than an inconvenience they’re dangerous especially when combined with rising unemployment and in developing countries where the food supply chains are already fragile and hundreds of millions of people rely on agriculture for their livelihoods the pandemic limited access to credit slowed the transportation of goods and froze incomes but you can’t plan for a pandemic or can you the big question now is—where does food go from here seeds of stability the supply chain starts with seeds what if we could make them more resilient ad alvarez is a leader on his island and a bit of a pioneer he farms in the philippines and though his corn operation is relatively large the majority of his neighbors’ farms are less than a hectare in size alvarez says many of the other farmers on his island rely on imported food they can’t grow enough to sustain themselves or make a viable living from farming and that was before the shutdown “we never prepared for something like this” he says there’s a saying in the philippines: when your blanket is too short learn to bend your legs ad alvarez the philippines the majority of farms on his island are like small blankets but what if we could find ways to fit more underneath “i started introducing bt corn on the island because we wanted to test it first” says alvarez this type of genetically modified corn is higher-performing and more resistant to pests in the philippines corn farmers with small landholdings traditionally see a harvest of about 600 kilograms per hectare alvarez’s first harvest using bt corn was about 14 times that 00:00 it’s clear to alvarez and other community leaders that access to this type of innovation could mean real economic and social progress for the families in his municipality especially during a pandemic “at the end of the day we have to give our farmers the tools they need” he says of course i’m dreaming but that’s how innovations happen—when you start dreaming most people would say it’s impossible but we have put a man on the moon and that was impossible so we should really give the freedom to dream and the tenacity to make it work ad alvarez the philippines bananas and bandwidth digitizing our food system starts on the farm new technology creates new realities and the digitalization of agriculture is helping farmers around the world reimagine the way our food system works — and who works it “you need to keep young people working in rural areas there is a lot of immigration from rural to urban areas because young people don’t think they have a future” says ronald guendel global head of food security and advocacy at the crop science division of bayer guendel has a lot of big ideas for improving our food system and one of them is to embrace digital innovation how does he think digital agriculture can engage a younger generation “you create a system where they feel needed you create new enterprises where they can provide support” he says and there’s no doubt they are needed climate change food security and growing global food demands are challenges that will have a disproportionate impact on younger generations guendel has seen progress in action he recently visited a banana plantation in ecuador and talked to a group of young farmers there who were leveraging satellite imagery to monitor their crops from space they then used that data to apply nitrogen more precisely this allowed them to use less fertilizer while seeing stronger harvests 00:00 this type of sustainable solution—one that uses data to conserve resources—is on the rise in agriculture but not all aech orbits the earth robots are being tasked to plant pluck and protect crops all around the world “some growers and farmers have been investing in technologies in the last several years and that’s paying off incredibly well right now” says cathy burns ceo at produce marketing association a trade organization that advocates for stakeholders all along the produce and floral supply chains automation is reconfiguring our entire food system not just farming you may have seen it in your local grocery store retailers are using robots to monitor inventory and even clean up spills automation isn’t going anywhere it’s going everywhere including your doorstep “over the past seven months investors have pumped at least us $6 billion 53 billion euros into more than two dozen companies involved in autonomous delivery of goods and foods” says burns and with all of this technology comes data—numbers we can put to use up and down the food supply chain these insights help tie the whole thing together sustainably collaboration is the new currency traceability it will truly create a more nimble food system whether it ends on a fork between chopsticks or between fingertips food starts on a farm and it takes a lot of people time and energy to get it from one place to another but what if everyone tasked with growing transporting packaging and selling food worked together for the sake of our planet and its people that’s what ad alvarez ronald guendel cathy burns and other experts want to see “collaboration is the new currency” says burns collaboration along the entire food chain would mean reducing waste it would mean better visibility for consumers it would mean more reliable markets for farmers and it could mean more flexibility during a public health emergency this will certainly help if we’re hit with another pandemic but even as we look at crises from shortages of product to produce safety outbreaks leveraging technologies like blockchain will become more and more important to be able to trace back product all the way to the farm cathy burns united states blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology where everyone along the supply chain from farmers to grocers—and every supplier in between—tracks products as they move chronologically when one stakeholder updates information about a piece of produce everyone else has access to that data food becomes traceable in a reimagined supply chain seed companies work with farmers to solve problems for processors grocers and ultimately consumers 00:00 take strawberries for example in the near future autonomous strawberry pickers will roll through row after row of green leaves sensing and scanning for the perfect berry it’s the type of technology cathy burns says farmers are investing in because it has the potential to solve important challenges like supplementing labor when there is a shortage making easier work of a typically intensive manual process and helping to keep farm workers safe however plucking a delicate berry with a robotic arm takes cutting-edge precision and a hearty berry what if seed companies could make it a little easier on the roboticists “it’s another opportunity to work upstream with a company like bayer to determine what’s the breeding capability we need could we have a hearty strawberry that’s incredibly flavorful that actually enhances the consumer experience” burns wonders it’s been heart-warming over the last three months the openness the transparency the candor to come together to address the systemic issues that will have long-term positive effect cathy burns united states innovation more than ever to stabilize our supply chains and support the communities that depend on them we’ll need to lean into the solutions we strived toward in 2019 even more in 2020 and beyond that means accelerating innovation not stalling it what we need now is an open-arms type of globalization where we share ideas to end the pandemic and to get through it “of course i’m dreaming” says ad alvarez from his farm in the philippines “but that’s how innovations happen—when you start dreaming most people would say it’s impossible but we have put a man on the moon and that was impossible so we should really give the freedom to dream and the

plant breeding openlabs news & stories events bayer innovation youth ag summit podcast contact us carbon farming to address a changing climate carbon is an often misunderstood protagonist in agriculture and climate science consider the carbon atom: six protons and six neutrons surrounded by six orbiting electrons without it life as we know it doesn’t exist in fact the term “carbon-based lifeform” is used to describe anything in the universe that approximates what we consider to be “alive” together with hydrogen and oxygen carbon is one of the literal building blocks of all life on earth—including crops and the countless people who rely on them 00:00 farming and climate change every aspect of our climate—including temperature sunlight rain and wind—is important to agriculture conversely agriculture is increasingly important for our climate as civilization has evolved we have developed a more nuanced understanding of how carbon contributes to climate change as well as the roles that fossil fuels deforestation and tillage play in the carbon cycle in agriculture plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy molecules called carbohydrates this process contributes to the air we breathe and the food we eat in climate science carbon affects global temperatures soil salinity ocean levels weather patterns and more as our understanding of farming carbon and the climate has deepened agricultural scientists have incorporated new knowledge and insights that enable farmers to reduce carbon emissions thrive in the face of climate change and even mitigate its effects agricultural innovation and environmental stewardship enrich one another as one of the best examples the climate fieldview™ digital farming platform is empowering farmers around the world to cultivate their crops while reducing the impact on our planet by harnessing data gathered from satellites in-field sensors and smart combines the climate fieldview™ app uses historic insight and predictive analytics to help farmers connect more intimately with their fields so they can identify and address problems before they take hold in addition to helping farmers accomplish more with fewer resources it also helps to reduce carbon emissions by maximizing efficiencies coupled with digital sensors that monitor the soil’s composition farmers can actively track their progress in sequestering carbon in their fields to support more productive crops and a healthier planet 00:00 the path to net-zero carbon emissions starts on the farm the emissions produced by farming come partially from tilling the soil and burning fossil fuels to run equipment every time a tractor travels across a field it generates emissions that’s why crop scientists and data engineers have developed tools like smart gps and techniques such as precision agriculture to help farmers reduce fuel consumption practices such as no-till farming are also exceedingly beneficial in reducing emissions because they keep carbon in the soil where it actually benefits the plants and microorganisms that need carbon to thrive innovations in agriculture are transforming farms to not only reduce their emissions but also pull carbon out of the atmosphere this is the insight behind bayer’s carbon program in the us which enables and incentivizes farmers to adopt climate-smart practices that capture and store carbon in their fields similar programs are now live in brazil and select european countries by simultaneously prioritizing soil health farmers’ livelihoods and our climate this global initiative is laying strong foundations for a net-zero carbon emissions future that’s good for growers consumers and our planet grower jason lay: bayer us carbon program 2:00 00:00 closing in on carbon literacy as the building block of life carbon itself is not inherently problematic—rather it’s the imbalance of carbon in our atmosphere that causes widespread climate challenges through agriculture today’s brightest minds are finding ways to correct that imbalance to support our climate now and well into the future by driving unprecedented breakthroughs in data science farmer incentives and climate-smart agricultural practices modern agriculture is helping growers improve their operations while reducing their impact on the climate the impact of these innovations is immense not only in helping ensure

podcast contact us picture a snow globe inside its crystalline sphere the conditions are always ideal for a winter wonderland — even in the hottest days of summer so what if farmers could take this idea and use it to create optimal self-contained cultivation environments that allowed them to grow their crops during the dead of winter a traditional approach to this challenge is greenhouse farming in which glass or plastic domes heighten and retain solar energy as a result the temperature inside the dome stays warmer and more stable allowing farmers to cultivate warm-weather crops during the cold seasons 00:00 vertical indoor farms take some of these advantages such as controlled indoor conditions and electronic efficiency measures to the next level in fact a single vertical farm can grow 4 hectares 10 acres — or roughly five olympic-size swimming pools — worth of food on less than half a hectare of land making it ideal for urban areas and in preserving space for biodiversity vertical farms are on the rise there are currently 204387 sq m about 22 million sq ft of indoor farms operating across the globe and that number is expected to increase almost tenfold to 2 million sq m about 22 million sq ft in the next five years will vertical farming replace other farming environments no but the dramatic rise in indoor farms will help grow fresh produce in new spaces using fewer natural resources complementing the advancements being made in traditional sun-soaked outdoor crops why such an exponential increase in interest and investment in vertical farms in short they offer profound potential for sustainability and food security helping protect our environmental economic and societal ecosystems and they do so while helping to meet the increasing need and desire for locally-grown produce 00:00 moving indoors to protect the outdoors the most widely discussed benefit of vertical indoor farming is its ability to greatly conserve natural resources such as water land and nutrients while also improving harvests for select crops like leafy greens tomatoes berries and herbs interestingly enough the technologies that vertical farms utilize often overlap those used to optimize the growth of outdoor crops the relationship between indoor farms and nature is as interesting as it is mutual broadly speaking vertical indoor farms create ideal growing conditions for plants they do this by insulating crops from the harsh extremes of climate change and seasonality at the same time these self-contained precision growing systems protect the exterior environment by conserving natural resources and limiting inputs and of course the benefits don’t end there the novel growing environment can contribute to a reduction in both food loss and food waste shorter growing cycles mean more flexibility for plant growth and the controlled process delivers a fresher more consistent and in many cases locally-grown product to consumers 00:00 frost can’t bite so farmers can grow their crops year-round pests cant pester so farmers can dramatically reduce inputs nutrients stay put so farmers can conserve natural resources moisture is recycled so farmers can use virtually every single drop to increase water efficiency by up to 90% land is barely needed so farmers can grow enough with less helping lift the economy a few years ago many viewed vertical farming as largely theoretical today the practice has blossomed into a major worldwide industry with a current market value just shy of €134 billion or $15 billion annually one of the biggest reasons vertical farming is now feasible is due to the advancement of sensors smart energy systems and other technologies that make growing more efficient just like the many people using smart devices and automation to make their homes more convenient vertical farms are typically automated to control light temperature and water use they allow farmers to optimize the conditions required for growing to produce the food that consumers want most at the store these next-tier structures help realize the full potential of seed genetics using data ai and machine learning to bolster efficiencies save resources and reduce the cost of growing crops vertically 00:00 modern technologies can drastically reduce the overall energy consumption of specific plants some systems can even use cameras and sensors to assess when crops are ready for harvest identifying exactly when to pick specific plants this process has already been shown to significantly reduce the food waste that sometimes comes with full-field harvests technologies don’t have to be extreme to make a significant difference in vertical farms even subtle innovations like advanced led bulbs are helping to cut costs increasing energy efficiency while drastically reducing heat waste within the system taken together vertical indoor farms and automated technologies are producing a 100-fold increase in efficiency to generate 10 times the harvest while using only one-tenth of the resources that’s a pleasing cost-to-benefit ratio especially when you consider that many of these digital tools are bringing similar results to outdoor farms the rise of social standards the breakthrough of vertical indoor farming is driving positive social change as well because indoor farms can operate anywhere they are not subject to the same geographic or environmental limitations of outdoor farms in fact they are already building communities by bringing fresh produce to people in areas that are removed from farms markets and grocery stores these hyperlocal indoor farms are breaking down many other boundaries typically associated with our food system in urban environments farmers are making use of repurposed shipping containers and abandoned buildings to bring food closer to the fridge this shortened supply chain reduces the reliance on fossil fuels to transport produce from far-away farms while also reducing the loss of food that gets damaged or spoils along the journey the close proximity of vertical indoor farms within more urban areas also helps farmers encourage their new neighbors to become more engaged in collectively building a more sustainable future on a global scale the cost efficiencies of vertical farming are becoming increasingly available to both industrialized and developing nations particularly in asia where land is not always available to grow enough food government and private sector groups are supporting research to lower the threshold for vertical farms the result greater food security and a meaningful impact throughout the region — and by extension across the globe taking agriculture to the next level as climate change and a growing global population continue to raise the stakes for our food system vertical farming is emerging as one of many complementary solutions in our collective pursuit of sustainability leaps by bayer and singapore-based temasek have already joined together to form unfold bio an innovative company focused on developing vegetable seeds for vertical farming their goal to grow new varieties of crops paired with agronomic advice suited for the unique indoor environment of this rising industry companies like unfold hope to supply restaurants airlines schools hospitals businesses grocery stores and on-line delivery services — both in city centers and throughout food deserts — with fresh sustainable and hyper-local produce with a smaller ecological footprint what’s more: vertical and outdoor farms are exploring parallel paths of innovation to create technologies that fuel the potential of every farm with these ongoing breakthroughs in robotics and ai people from city-centers to developing countries can enjoy new relationships with the possibilities vision and resourcefulness of modern agriculture the food and agriculture organization of the united nations has declared 2021 the international year of fruits and vegetables with an
