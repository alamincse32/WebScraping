manufacturing side of the industry in 1988 when our board company realized we had customers looking for cedar decking and porch components that is when mr spindle was born we started with a hand full of parts being produced and since evolved into a company which produces about 400 different products with additional products being added each day custom turning and restoration jobs have been a

damaged we do not want to be responsible for those situations on very limited occasions we do come across some defected material that doesn’t get caught in our double check process sanding and boxing send us pictures send us an email call us we won’t leave you out in the woods some spindles get made in about 30 seconds which doesn’t give us a great deal of time to hand sand and inspect the parts

9,sustainable and eco-friendly woodworking mr spindle skip to content using renewable wood resources our customers might notice we use the shorter lenhs available in cedar and redwood for our products by using lenhs down to 5″ pieces of fiber for our post caps and in our finger jointing program we have helped develop an industry that is now using what was once scrap lumber truly a renewable resource cedar and redwood manufacturers are now using everything including the saw dust … please use our products with the knowledge that our industry is truly “green” thank you cedar cedar has become a preferred wood for interiors and exteriors of both residential and commercial buildings its versatility and appeal to several architectural designs make it one of today’s more requested softwoods even though cedar is fairly light weight quality conscious builders choose this material for its strenh it’s the perfect choice to be used throughout a building’s structure cedar has a built-in natural preservative which resists decay and deterioration making it an ideal light framing material for fencing and decking as the production of cedar continues to increase responsible logging practices continue to improve western red cedar is a very tolerant tree … it suffers little from insect attack cedar can be grown in shady conditions thrives in favorable conditions and can withstand strong winds due to its fully developed root system and large buttresses there is about 44 billion board feet of western red cedar sawtimber on commercial timberland in the united states oregon and washinon have more than half of this volume an estimated 87 billion cubic feet of growing stock occurs in washinon idaho alaska oregon montana and california redwood redwood’s versatile beauty and durability have made it one of today’s classic building materials it’s one wood that is appealing in any architectural style whether it be a traditional residential home or a contemporary office building redwood is unmatched in its long lasting elegant appearance by any other wood species or synthetic building materials including woods treated with chemicals the advantages of using redwood for exterior applications have been known for many years the inherent natural chemicals it contains gives redwood a unique resistance to weather and insect causing decay this makes it a perfect choice for decks fences and shelters some of redwood’s other characteristics include its resistance to shrinking warping checking and its ability to hold a variety of finishes because of its dimensional stability many people assume because of the overwhelming size of the redwood tree they are irreplaceable and should be protected from harvesting when in reality the redwood is the best protected tree in the united states the society of american foresters estimates there are more coastal redwoods in existance today than when logging began in the region today california is home to more than 17 million acres of redwood forests the society estimated that coastal redwoods occupied no more than 100000 acres of forestlands in 1964 this total area increased to 181000 acres in 1978 today more than 400000 acres are set aside in public parks reserves campgrounds wilderness areas and nature study areas for public use these massive redwoods are proud to hold the record for being the tallest trees in the world spectacular old-growth groves are typically found at the mouths of rivers and where centuries of periodic flooding deposited layers of nutrient-rich soils virtually all old-growth trees are protected from harvest and forestry companies invest millions of dollars to improve water quality throughout the redwood region redwoods are also the fastest growing commercial softwood trees in the united states trees that are four to ten years old normally grow two to six feet per year redwood lumber comes from privately owned second- and third-generation forests which have raised sustainable forestry to new levels with active management forest-regeneration and continued conservation we will be blessed with more redwoods in the near future than we currently have

western hemlock in most places where it grows it is found at the elevation range of sea level to a maximum of 2290 m above sea level at crater lake in oregon in addition to growing in lush forests and mountainsides western redcedar is also a riparian tree and grows in many forested swamps and streambanks in its range the tree is shade-tolerant and able to reproduce under dense shade it has been introduced to other temperate zones including western europe australia at least as far north as sydney new zealand the eastern united states at least as far north as central new york and higher elevations of hawaii thujaplicin thujaplicin a chemical substance is found in mature trees and serves as a natural fungicide thereby preventing the wood from rotting this effect lasts around a century even after the tree is felled however thujaplicin is only found in older trees and saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow rotten trunk uses the soft red-brown timber has a tight straight grain and few knots it is valued for its distinct appearance aroma and its high natural resistance to decay being extensively

23,about us - mr spindle inc skip to content the goal of the mr spindle company is to give its customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price our vast array of spindles balusters porch posts newel posts columns custom turnings finials handrails and post tops are produced from the world’s finest cedar redwood brazilian ipe and american pine our products will help you create the porch or deck your family will enjoy for years to come mr spindle also has an assortment of interior products also we have been selling cedar boards since 1977 we came into the manufacturing side of the industry in 1988 when our board company realized we had customers looking for cedar decking and porch components that is when mr spindle was born we started with a hand full of parts being produced and since evolved into a company which produces about 400 different products with additional products being added each day custom turning and restoration jobs have been a strong part of that addition to our line over the last 10 years custom jobs enable us to add about 2-3 parts per week send us your picture and we can see if we’ve manufactured it before and if not we will add it to our library of products at a reasonable price we have so many styles that are not pictured don’t settle for something when restoring history quality mr spindle stands by the quality of its products if there is a problem please let us know within 72 hours of receiving your product cedar is a very soft wood and if left on the jobsite for an extended period of time it may become damaged we do not want to be responsible for those situations on very limited occasions we do come across some defected material that doesn’t get caught in our double check process sanding and boxing send us pictures send us an email call us we won’t leave you out in the woods some spindles get made in about 30 seconds which doesn’t give us a great deal of time to hand sand and inspect the parts if you purchase treated material that pressure treating can do some amazing things to a piece of wood our treated material is air dried prior to manufacturing so stability should not be a problem mother nature on the other hand does some strange things which we cannot prevent ultimately the goal of the mr spindle company is to give it’s customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price we hope to help you create a recreational backyard environment which can be enjoyed by your family for years to come by utilizing what was once waste wood in the forests of america history being a family owned small business the matthews family has strived to establish the mr spindle company as the benchmark for quality and on time delivery in the decking components industry since 1988 our company has continued to grow producing better and easier to use products we are proudly selling across america initially using the traditional high volume copy lathes we have evolved with state of the art computer controlled lathes and cnc tables so that today we can mimic or reproduce most any style turning you can imagine until early in 2020 there were two custom turning companies in north dakota cinder whit & company cinderwhitcom located in wahpeton and mr spindle inc located in fargo cinder whit is no longer in business we at mr spindle have been turning similar products as cinder whit for over 30 years and would be happy to earn your business shipping our stock items generally ship within two days with most orders shipping that same day or next day our
