directly on laminate surface use a trivet or other protective surface under pots/pans waffle irons curing irons clothing irons etc do not use knives or other sharp utensils that may slice or scratch the laminate surface use a cutting board for chopping and slicing do not slide abrasive items such as ceramics across laminate surface use a place mat or protective surface underneath these items cleaning for everyday cleaning use a clean damp non-abrasive cloth with a mild detergent or household cleaner for stuck-on residue scrub with a nylon bristled brush for cleaning difficult stains apply a paste of baking soda and water to draw out the stain blot away with a damp cloth – do not rub never use cleaners containing acid alkali or bleach general care never place hot pans directly from the burner or oven on a solid surface countertop while solid surface can withstand sustained temperatures up to 225°f prolonged or extreme heat could cause yellowing always use a trivet under heated appliances such as crock-pots electric frying pans etc strong acids – like those found in drain toilet bowl and oven cleaners – should be used cautiously around solid surfaces if any of these items come in contact with a solid surface countertop wipe them up at once some of these items when left on the surface may cause whitening which can be difficult to remove cleaning solid surface countertops are nonporous so everyday cleaning only requires a damp cloth and a mild cleanser if you’ve chosen a matte finish feel free to use an abrasive cleaner like ajax or comet however if you do use an abrasive cleaner we recommend periodically cleaning the entire surface in a circular motion to maintain uniformity some tough spills and stains such as food dye tea and fruit drinks may require more aggressive cleaning these common stains can be removed with full-strenh bleach followed by a general cleanser bleach should only come in contact with the surface for 2-5 minutes be sure to rinse your surface with clean water afterwards on a matte finish bleach can be avoided by scrubbing with an abrasive cleaner while solid surface will not burn if a lit cigarette touches your solid surface countertop it could leave a nicotine stain or scorch mark these can be removed by using an abrasive cleaner or buffing in a circular motion with a scotch-brite pad repairing scratches for removing superficial scratches rub in a circular motion with a wet scotch-brite hand pad 7448 until the scratches are removed clean thoroughly with soap and water then let dry deep scratches can be removed by carefully and lightly sanding with 120-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit and 320-grit sandpaper after sanding rub the surface with a wet scotch-brite hand pad 7448 in a circular motion to restore the finish once the surface is dry apply a non-wax polish cleaner or other recommended surface dressing for added protection or more luster wipe with a clean dry cloth wipe dry using another clean cloth severe damage should your solid surface countertop sustain a deep gouge fracture crack or any other severe damage contact us and a professional countertop fabricator will repair the surface to its original state general care quartz countertops may not withstand the direct and sudden transfer of heat from pots pans and other cooking units and heated items use a hot pad or trivet underneath these items to prevent damaging your quartz countertop or surface whether high neutral or low ph do not expose quartz to abrasive or strong alkaline acid or oxidizer cleaner avoid abrasive or strong free radicals various chemicals are corrosive and/or erosive in their ability to attack any structure including quartz be very aware of these potential damages to your surface where there are visible seams in the quartz surface the product pattern and shade can change avoid hitting surfaces with force as the quartz may chip or crack cleaning do not use or expose quartz countertops to such products including but not limited to the following: bleach oven cleaners comet soft scrub sos products with pumice batteries paint removers furniture strippers tarnish silver cleaners or similar products do not use abrasive or harsh scrub pads do not apply any sealers penetrants or topical treatments to quartz under any circumstances these products will wear off and cause the gloss to appear dull or inconsistent semi-polished finishes 1cm will not shine and will soil the countertops they will appear stained from soiling general installation quartz is not a structural support product quartz surfaces with 2cm and 3cm thicknesses are for countertops and must be supported quartz with 1cm thickness is for surface finishes such as walls tub and shower surrounds and fireplaces in addition horizontal applications such as a tub deck must be completely supported quartz installation is optimized when walls and cabinets are properly prepared for installation this includes but is not limited to structurally sound straight level and square walls and cabinets lack of preparation may cause poor installation poor seam fit inconsistent countertop inconsistent overhang and inconsistent placement disclaimer: quartz installation does not include qualification of any sink or stove cutouts any cutouts faucet hole locations or cabinet sizes we are not responsible for verifying if the sink stove cutout appliances cabinets and faucet hole locations fit together well or at all this is the responsibility of the owner and/or general contractor we will fabricate cutouts per supplied model/template information we are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided general care do not apply too much weight to any one spot as this may cause the granite countertop to crack do not sit or stand on the countertop’s surface also be observant of what wall decorations hang over the stone countertops if the hanging decorations are heavy and fall onto the surface the natural stone may crack under the stress always use coasters under cups and drinking glasses do not use the countertop as a cutting board as this may scratch the stone always place heat-resistant mats under kitchen or bath appliances dishes or china regularly dust granite countertops islands and vanities regularly clean stone surfaces with warm water and a soft cloth or check with a local granite expo for a specialty cleaning agent blot spills immediately non-evaporating liquids exg: oils that are not blotted within 1-2 minutes will stain evaporating liquids such as water wine and grape juice will temporarily leave a dark spot but may stain if the stone countertop or surface is not properly sealed avoid placing excessive weight on these surfaces sitting or standing on them is not recommended avoid sudden/rapid changes in temperature as this may cause damage to the surface cleaning granite countertops and surfaces need to be cleaned regularly to maintain their natural sheen and vitality in the event of a spill blot the spill with a paper towel immediately don’t wipe the area as this will spread the spill into your countertop flush the area with plain water and mild soap then rinse several times dry the area thoroughly with a soft cloth repeat as necessary clean granite surfaces with a few drops of non-acidic soap scum remover a mild liquid dishwashing detergent or denatured alcohol use a specialty cleaning agent made for natural stone these specialty cleaning agents will remove oil residue and help clean up everyday food or bath and beauty product spills thoroughly rinse and dry the surface after washing too much cleaner or soap may leave a film and cause streaks do not use products that contain lemon vinegar or other acid content that may etch the surface do not use abrasive cleaners such as dry cleaners or soft cleansers do not use cleaners that contain acids such as bathroom cleaners grout cleaners or tile cleaners do not apply acetone or any type of paint thinner keep in mind that spills of certain chemicals – especially acids or alkali products – will permanently stain the stone therefore it is important to consider sealing granite countertops and surfaces for an extra layer of protection and to carefully observe prevention measures do not mix bleach and ammonia this combination creates a toxic and lethal gas frequent or over-use of soap scum remover could result in dulling the surface of the stone sealing re-application of sealer is recommended after 1-2 years which can be easily done at home different types of natural stone surfaces require different resealing frequency all-natural stone is porous and should be sealed before use sealing will make the granite surface more durable against wear and tear sealer comes in water-based or oil-based variants and can have a natural or glossy finish water-based sealers are easier to apply and safer for the environment if your granite countertop has a shiny polished surface avoid using a sealer with a glossy finish applying sealer in most cases is quite simple does not require any special tools and can be completed in a few minutes wait at least 72 hours after the initial installation before applying sealer before sealing it’s important to clean the granite countertop a mild liquid detergent usually does the trick but use denatured alcohol for the best results after cleaning completely dry the surface apply the sealer according to the manufacturer’s instructions wait at least 2 hours before applying an additional coat generally one coat is sufficient but you may want to apply as many as three coats in a high traffic area test your granite countertops to see if they need an additional coat by applying a few drops of water to the surface the water droplets should not be absorbed by the granite if they get absorbed within a few minutes it needs an additional coat of sealer food safety natural stone is not approved by the national sanitation foundation international for meeting food preparation standards because it is highly porous and absorbs moisture general care if your wood countertops are showing small scratches lightly sand out flaws and re-oil the surface to restore it for cutting surfaces choose an unsealed oil-finished product designed for food preparation if you’re considering purchasing or already own a natural wood countertop for food preparation here are some helpful maintenance tips: before use oil the cutting surface with food grade mineral oil or emmet’s elixir an all-natural anti-microbial wood conditioner the board or block was oiled during construction but may have dried during storage and shipping be sure to coat the top bottom ends and edges of the block every time you oil it apply oil often especially when the block appears to be dry do not submerse the board in water instead clean it with a wet cloth or sponge using a mild liquid detergent you can use a disinfecting cleanser or a mixture of one teaspoon of chlorine bleach to one quart of water rinse well do not use powder cleanser allow the board to dry in a rack or with the board standing on edge to ensure sufficient air flow all the way around the board to increase the life of the board flip it over and use both sides when determining how often to oil a block the general rule of thumb is to oil it once a day for a week upon purchase; once a week for a month; and once a month forever the block should be oiled whenever the wood starts to look dry and chalky care & cleaning sfi products require minimal care to maintain their original beauty avoid exposure to strong chemicals if strong chemicals/cleaners containing methylene chloride acetone nail polish remover or acid drain cleaners come in contact with your vanity top or bowl quickly flush the surface with plenty of soapy warm water even though all surfaces are non-porous use of hair dye has been known to stain light colored tops cleaners with bleach may

However, if you do use an abrasive cleaner, we recommend periodically cleaning the entire surface in a circular motion to maintain uniformity. Some tough spills and stains, such as food dye, tea, and fruit drinks, may require more aggressive cleaning. These common stains can be removed with full-strength bleach, followed by a general cleanser. Bleach should only come in contact with the surface for 2-5 minutes (be sure to rinse your surface with clean water afterwards). On a matte finish, bleach can be avoided by scrubbing with an abrasive cleaner. While solid surface will not burn, if a lit cigarette touches your solid surface countertop, it could leave a nicotine stain or scorch mark. These can be removed by using an abrasive cleaner or buffing in a circular motion with a Scotch-Brite pad. Repairing Scratches For removing superficial scratches, rub in a circular motion with a wet Scotch-Brite hand pad #7448 until the scratches are removed. Clean thoroughly with soap and water, then let dry. Deep scratches can be removed by carefully and lightly sanding with 120-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit and 320-grit sandpaper. After sanding, rub the surface with a wet Scotch-Brite hand pad #7448 in a circular motion to restore the finish. Once the surface is dry, apply a non-wax polish cleaner or other recommended surface dressing for added protection or more luster. Wipe with a clean, dry cloth. Wipe dry using another clean cloth. Severe Damage Should your solid surface countertop sustain a deep gouge, fracture, crack, or any other severe damage, contact us, and a professional countertop fabricator will repair the surface to its original state. General Care Quartz countertops may not withstand the direct and sudden transfer of heat from pots, pans, and other cooking units and heated items. Use a hot pad or trivet underneath these items to prevent damaging your quartz countertop or surface. Whether high, neutral, or low pH, do not expose quartz to abrasive or strong alkaline, acid, or oxidizer cleaner. Avoid abrasive or strong free radicals. Various chemicals are corrosive and/or erosive in their ability to attack any structure, including quartz. Be very aware of these potential damages to your surface. Where there are visible seams in the quartz surface, the product pattern and shade can change. Avoid hitting surfaces with force, as the quartz may chip or crack. Cleaning Do not use or expose quartz countertops to such products including, but not limited to the following: bleach, oven cleaners, Comet, Soft Scrub, SOS, products with pumice, batteries, paint removers, furniture strippers, tarnish, silver cleaners, or similar products. Do not use abrasive or harsh scrub pads. Do not apply any sealers, penetrants, or topical treatments to quartz under any circumstances. These products will wear off and cause the gloss to appear dull or inconsistent. Semi-polished finishes (1cm) will not shine and will soil the countertops. They will appear stained from soiling. General Installation Quartz is not a structural support product. Quartz surfaces with 2cm and 3cm thicknesses are for countertops and must be supported. Quartz with 1cm thickness is for surface finishes such as walls, tub and shower surrounds, and fireplaces. In addition, horizontal applications (such as a tub deck) must be completely supported. Quartz installation is optimized when walls and cabinets are properly prepared for installation. This includes but is not limited to structurally sound, straight, level, and square walls and cabinets. Lack of preparation may cause poor installation, poor seam fit, inconsistent countertop, inconsistent overhang, and inconsistent placement. Disclaimer: Quartz installation does not include qualification of any sink or stove cutouts (any cutouts), faucet hole locations, or cabinet sizes. We are not responsible for verifying if the sink, stove, cutout appliances, cabinets, and faucet hole locations fit together well (or at all). This is the responsibility of the owner and/or general contractor. We will fabricate cutouts per supplied model/template information. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. General Care Do not apply too much weight to any one spot, as this may cause the granite countertop to crack. Do not sit or stand on the countertop’s surface. Also, be observant of what wall decorations hang over the stone countertops. If the hanging decorations are heavy and fall onto the surface, the natural stone may crack under the stress. Always use coasters under cups and drinking glasses. Do not use the countertop as a cutting board, as this may scratch the stone. Always place heat-resistant mats under kitchen or bath appliances, dishes, or china. Regularly dust granite countertops, islands, and vanities. Regularly clean stone surfaces with warm water and a soft cloth, or check with a local Granite Expo for a specialty cleaning agent. Blot spills immediately. Non-evaporating liquids (exg: oils) that are not blotted within 1-2 minutes will stain. Evaporating liquids such as water, wine, and grape juice will temporarily leave a dark spot, but may stain if the stone countertop or surface is not properly sealed. Avoid placing excessive weight on these surfaces. Sitting or standing on them is not recommended. Avoid sudden/rapid changes in temperature as this may cause damage to the surface.

Don’t wipe the area, as this will spread the spill into your countertop. Flush the area with plain water and mild soap, then rinse several times. Dry the area thoroughly with a soft cloth. Repeat as necessary. Clean granite surfaces with a few drops of non-acidic soap scum remover, a mild liquid dishwashing detergent, or denatured alcohol. Use a specialty cleaning agent made for natural stone. These specialty cleaning agents will remove oil, residue, and help clean up everyday food or bath and beauty product spills. Thoroughly rinse and dry the surface after washing. Too much cleaner or soap may leave a film and cause streaks. Do not use products that contain lemon, vinegar, or other acid content that may etch the surface. Do not use abrasive cleaners, such as dry cleaners or soft cleansers. Do not use cleaners that contain acids such as bathroom cleaners, grout cleaners, or tile cleaners. Do not apply acetone or any type of paint thinner. Keep in mind that spills of certain chemicals – especially acids or alkali products – will permanently stain the stone. Therefore, it is important to consider sealing granite countertops and surfaces for an extra layer of protection and to carefully observe prevention measures. Do not mix bleach and ammonia. This combination creates a toxic and lethal gas. Frequent or over-use of soap scum remover could result in dulling the surface of the stone. Sealing Re-application of sealer is recommended after 1-2 years, which can be easily done at home. Different types of natural stone surfaces require different resealing frequency. All-natural stone is porous and should be sealed before use. Sealing will make the granite surface more durable against wear and tear. Sealer comes in water-based or oil-based variants and can have a natural or glossy finish. Water-based sealers are easier to apply and safer for the environment. If your granite countertop has a shiny polished surface, avoid using a sealer with a glossy finish. Applying sealer in most cases is quite simple, does not require any special tools, and can be completed in a few minutes. Wait at least 72 hours after the initial installation before applying sealer.

If strong chemicals/cleaners containing methylene chloride acetone (nail polish remover), or acid drain cleaners come in contact with your vanity top or bowl, quickly flush the surface with plenty of soapy warm water. Even though all surfaces are non-porous, use of hair dye has been known to stain light colored tops. Cleaners with bleach may counteract the stain, but are not not recommended for general cleaning. Tops with Matte Finish Tops with a matte finish can be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge using general purpose cleaners. SFI’s products with a matte finish require minimal care to maintain their original beauty. These surfaces are non-porous so they can be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge using non-abrasive cleaners. The surface may need occasional polishing to maintain the gloss appearance. You can purchase polish products at your local home improvement store. Follow instructions carefully as build up of polish will cause tops to look dull. Tops with Gloss Finish Tops with a gloss finish can be cleaned with a damp cloth using non-abrasive cleaners. SFI’s products with a gloss finish require minimal care to maintain their original beauty.

If repair of this damage cannot be accomplished using the above steps, contact your dealer for further information and options. Tops with Gloss FinishRepairing of incidental scratches and stains: Sand area with wet 600 grit (or comparable grit) sand paper. Deeper scratches may require sanding with 300 grit sand paper, then 600 grit and then continuing on to Step 2. Sand same area with wet 1200 grit (or comparable grit) sand paper. Wash surface. When surface is completely dry, apply a buffing compound, available at most auto parts stores. Using a high speed buffer, buff entire area with buffing compound. Buff and re-apply compound until area is back to original shine.
