The North Dakota Industrial Commission, recently awarded a Renewable Energy Council Grant for $332,159 to BWR Innovations for their “SOL Source” Energy Project. This project will provide the Emerging Prairie’s Grand Farm with a “green”, self-sustaining electrical energy supply for their operation. BWR-Innovations has partnered with Intelligent Energy to bring their hydrogen fuel cell technology to this project. BWR Innovations CEO, Joel Jorgenson states, “We are very pleased that the Industrial Commission and Renewable Energy Council saw the potential of this proposal.” Jorgenson continues, “The “SOL Source” energy project is a full-scale farm project that will use solar and wind power to produce electricity and “green” hydrogen. The hydrogen will be used by a fuel cell to produce electricity when solar and wind cannot produce enough needed electricity. This is the first project of this size in North America, and we believe it will be a prototype for North Dakota farm site energy production and a potential revenue source as electricity or hydrogen sales. All of the energy produced is carbon-free and has a $0 variable cost.” “This builds and expands on the SOL Source project we have with Southern California Gas (SoCalGas)”, added Jorgenson. “The opportunity to power North Dakota family farms and small businesses is exciting.” David Fields, Head of Product Line, IE-Lift™ at Intelligent Energy, said: “We have been working alongside BWR for a number of years looking at providing hydrogen-powered solutions across a number of applications. Our IE-Lift fuel cell modules offer an output range of 1.2-4kW which can be scaled to achieve a higher power. They are ideal for applications such as this project as they are easy to integrate, offer low maintenance, and can be configured to work in a hybridized system with other renewable energy solutions. We at Intelligent Energy are proud to be working with BWR and Grand Farm on a key project such as the ‘SOL Source Energy Project’ which will provide a blueprint for hydrogen-powered energy solutions in the future. We hope this is the first of many such systems deployed in the State of North Dakota and across the United States.” About BWR Innovation and What We Do BWR Innovations, LLC is a Fargo, North Dakota-based private company with a team of seasoned, accomplished professionals that are creating innovative temperature monitoring, telemetry, and hydrogen/fuel cell-based products.

The presentations were engaging and the discussions were even better, offering a perspective on ALL the energy solutions that North Dakota can offer. We live in an exciting time, at the intersection of current energy needs (coal, oil and natural gas) and future energy demands (wind/solar energy and hydrogen). Technological capability is growing in the areas of renewable energy, like wind and solar. Bio-based offerings like ethanol and biodiesel are already incorporated into our daily lives. Life-changing green energies, like hydrogen, are just around the corner, stemming from sources as basic as water. North Dakota can and should lead the country in the development and use of these energy sources. Let’s continue to move forward as we work with every energy resource at our fingertips. The task is to continue the discussion and development of current energy resources but also keep pushing for growth in the new sources of energy that North Dakota can provide to our state and country. Again, thank you to the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber for hosting this event and to James Leiman for chairing. Congratulations, job well done!
