renewable fuels renewable fuels integrating renewable fuel technologies emission regulations are an ever-present concern for equipment manufacturers and customers within all industries as owners and operators of off-highway equipment continue to face ever-increasing demands for lower emissions and higher fuel economy john deere is making strategic investments in a diversified range of powertrain solutions to support its customers in future-proofing their equipment operations this includes investing in viable renewable fuel solutions that can address customers pain points and give them a competitive edge in the off-highway market with world-class engineering expertise john deere is simplifying the integration of renewable fuels with combustion engines to deliver more value and productivity renewable fuel compatibility with john deere engines petroleum-based fuels have been the industry standard for years this is primarily due to the lack of acceptable cost-effective and reliable alternatives however with growing interest in sustainable energy renewable fuels are becoming more widely adopted and readily available john deere considers biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel to be the most promising options for integration into the off-highway equipment industry john deere engines can use biodiesel: stage v engines operated within the european union can use biodiesel blends up to 8% b8 final tier 4/stage iv and interim tier 4/stage iii b engines can use biodiesel concentrations up to 20% b20 tier 3/stage iii a and lower tier engines can use up to 100% b100 biodiesel biodiesel must meet the standards set by the american society of testing materials astm d6751 or european standard en 14214 john deere engines can use renewable diesel fuel such as hvo: renewable diesel fuel paraffinic diesel fuel can be blended with petroleum diesel or used at 100% rd100 renewable diesel fuel must meet the standards set by either astm d975 en 590 or en 15940 the use of biofuels such as ethanol biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel can contribute to significant co2 reductions on a well-to-wheel basis john deere is continuing to explore new technologies that incorporate advanced combustion for continued compatibility with renewable fuels biodieselbiodiesel is a renewable oxygenated fuel made through transesterification of a variety of renewable resources such as vegetable oils soybean rapeseed etc and animal fat it can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend as a renewable domestic energy source biodiesel can help reduce dependence on petroleum imports renewable diesel fuelrenewable diesel fuel is a paraffinic fuel made by either hydrotreatment of renewable resources such as vegetable oils soybean rapeseed etc and animal fat or through a synthesis process such as gas-to-liquids l these biofuels offer a sustainable replacement for petroleum diesel fuel with comparable performance ethanolethanol is a renewable fuel made from corn and other plant materials ethanol is widely used in spark-ignition engines with the most common blend being e10 10% ethanol 90% gasoline with some engine modifications ethanol can potentially be used as a fuel in compression-ignition engines because of advancements being made in a variety of renewable fuel types compression ignition engines have a long life ahead

change system every 50 hours or at the end of your mowing season don’t drain engine oil ever again draining engine oil is so 2017 the engine modifications and new technologies are in the re-envisioned oil filter with a media designed to resist breaking down in oil over time is here the thousands of hours of testing are done the end result is an all-in-one oil and oil filter system like no other the

change™ engine oil filter now shop & buy turf-gard™ oil now here’s why: the new system captures contaminants and recharges your engine with nearly a quart 08qt 076 l of new oil in fact this system increases the amount of oil in the engine by nearly 40%2 your engine likes thatwhat do you mean i will never have to drain oil from my engine again how is that possible the answer is simple we have developed a better filtration system and filter design for our 100 series riding lawn tractors1 this fully synthetic filter media has greater surface area which increases its capacity to hold harmful contaminants what’s more the filter media is designed to resist breaking down in oil over time which means you’ll get a cooler running engine and a cooler running engine and better filtering helps increase engine oil life john deeres recommended oil service for 100 series riding lawn tractors1 is to change the system every 50 hours or once a season whichever comes first remember the system replaces a portion of your engine oil and thats plentythe system uses john deere turf-gard™ oil using john deere turf-gard™ oil ensures you are using the exact oil specified by john deere engineerstesting testing testing thanks to thousands of hours of rigorous and extensive testing you can feel confident your engine will run for years to come1the john deere easy change™ 30-second oil change system is available on e120 e130 e150 e160 e170 and e180 lawn tractors today2compared to similar v-twin engine models that do not have the john deere easy change™ 30-second oil change system that includes equivalent deere 2017 models and 2018 models without the system frequently asked questions: what is new with john deere riding lawn equipment we are excited about the exclusive john deere easy change™ 30 second oil change system exclusive to john deere and only available on certain models of the new 100 series lawn tractors these tractors are designed for ease of use for both operation and maintenance the john deere easy change™ system “easy change” allows the user to easily complete the recommended engine oil and filter maintenance in 30 seconds what is this new oil change system we changed the oil change the all-in-one oil and oil filter system gives the owner the ability to change a portion of the oil and the filter in less than 30 seconds what happens to the rest of the oil in the engine when the easy change system is replaced the easy change system replaces 8 quart of oil the remaining oil in the engine is refreshed by the charge of new oil included in the replacement easy change system combined with 40% more engine oil capacity improved filtration and cooler running temperatures which help extend oil life it is no longer necessary to remove and dispose of all the oil in your engine during service what makes the easy change system unique from other filters it is not just a filter it is a newly developed technology system that allows a new “filter” to come already charged with oil and allows you to remove an existing filter and the contaminants inside without tools and without making a mess beyond the filter technology within the canister and on your engine makes this possiblemodels with the easy change oil system use a fully synthetic filter that has more capacity to trap and hold contaminants the larger surface area of the easy change canister acts like a radiator helping the oil to stay cool does the easy change system somehow decrease the life of the engine the john deere 100 series lawn tractor models with and without easy change are specified for the same lifetime and are rigorously tested to the same standards to ensure the life of the tractor meets expectations can i add the easy change system to an existing tractor because this system also requires unique features within the engine the easy change system cannot be added to an engine that was not equipped with it at the factory can i change all the oil if i choose to you could if you wanted to there is an oil drain plug it is not required for maintenance how often do i need to change the easy change canister every 50 hours or once a year the 100 series lawn tractors with and without the easy change system have the same maintenance schedule what type of oil is recommended we recommend only john deere turf-gard™ 10w30 oil the easy change canister comes pre-filled with john deere turf-gard™ 10w30 oil how do i recycle the old oil many local government recycling programs authorized retailers auto repair stations and auto parts stores will puncture and recycle used oil filters and oil do i ever need to add oil yes consistent with our service recommendations for this product you should check oil level daily and add oil if required

operation john deere blades american-made using us steel alloy each john deere mower blade is manufactured for superiority engineered for excellence and designed to stay sharper longer shop john deere blades learn about john deere blades a smart investmentthe edge of our blades are rolled to reduce the risk of burrs and sharp corners which ultimately reduces the need for blade replacements and helps keep your operating costs down plus edge-rolling produces a sharper cutting surface from the start so youll get a high-quality cut every time less sharpenings more savingsthis same edge-roll design allows even distribution of stress over the blade surface producing a blade that retains its sharpness which reduces the need for sharpenings and saves you time and moneya proprietary heat treatment that provides ideal carbon levels also helps extend the life of our blades the right amount of carbon matters in producing a blade with excellent wear resistance and fatigue - too much means a weaker blade too little and the blade wears out quickly resulting in more blade replacements for you an intelligent designit only makes sense that john deere rotary mower blades fit perfectly on
