1,pervious concrete roller screed pervious concrete joint cutter and tools jobs you thought were impossible are just a screed away from possible pervious it’s beginning to seem that the entire world is going green with the lura screed and its line of pervious concrete finishing tools you’ll be ready to grow your own green business pervious concrete also known as “no fines” or “permeable” concrete allows water to flow through it making it ideal for storm water run-off control and earning leed certification in most cases features & benefits lightweight: because it can be filled with water lura screed is ideal when pouring pervious concrete each aluminum section weighs only 45 lbs and reaches 11 lbs when filled with water giving it ideal compressive weight this eliminates the need for sandbags or the addition of any extra weight; and because lura screed is 1/3 of the weight of most competitor units our system greatly reduces the risk of crew injuries it’s important for contractors to recognize that the weight of the screed itself doesn’t matter rather it’s the compressive weight of the system that makes a unit successful as long as the screed tube is resting on the forms and not floating crews can’t apply more pressure because the form will resist because it stays on the forms the lura screed system applies more pressure than competitor units because it stays on the forms exceptional cutting ability: but don’t think that lightweight translates to light work lura’s unique design provides exceptional cutting ability making it a true workhorse the riser wheels eliminate friction and make it easier to pull while its unique design and extraordinary cutting ability eliminate all unnecessary manpower convenience because pervious pours are done by panel riser wheels allow for more convenient application during fill-ins the riser wheels ensure that the only friction that exists is from the wet pervious concrete not the screed itself this eliminated friction translates to an easy to use system for virtually any operator durable: roller screeds are widely viewed as the best method to strike pervious concrete to avoid consolidating and is recommended by the nrmca the lura screed system compresses the pervious concrete tightens the aggregate and enhances the strenh and durability of the pervious concrete recommended by lura the following are accessories that enhance the success of pervious pours the cross roller: this roller is designed primarily for compaction and is used to create a more durable wear surface it’s applied as soon as the pervious concrete is leveled we’ve learned from years of experience that the right way to place pervious is by first elevating the screed tube and then rolling it down with the cross roller to compact the top surface this process is simple and effective the joint cutter: the joint cutter a weighted roller with a cutting wheel is used to put control joints into the pervious concrete soon after the cross roller is used this prevents cracking in weak areas custom cutters are available upon request to suit various thickness requirements adjustable curb runner: if pervious is being poured up against a sidewalk or a curb the adjustable curb runner might be necessary lura’s patented threaded axle design gives crews the flexibility to be right up against the edge eliminating a great deal of the hand finishing work that competitor systems leave behind painter’s plastic: lura incorporates painter’s plastic into their pervious curing process we do all the work – cross rolling and joint cutting over this plastic immediately after the concrete is struck off this method saves time and money while also increasing the success rate of the pour with pervious concrete it’s hugely important to get the poured concrete covered as quickly as possible the thin nature of the painter’s plastic allows it to stick to the cement paste creating a vacuum seal effect as an added security measure our team recommends placing 6-mil over the painter’s plastic the 6-mil is there to protect the painter’s plastic and ensure a proper concrete cure request a quote see our brochure innovation
2,sloped pours pouring concrete on a slope jobs you thought were impossible are just a screed away from possible sloped pours most paving equipment is designed to place concrete on fairly level surfaces but the world isn’t flat and sometimes structures such as canals or drainage channels require placing concrete on a slope the lurascreed is portable and lightweight making it ideal for uphill downhill and other sloped pours with competitive systems working on an incline or slope can be back breaking labor those systems often require striking off the concrete going up the slope causing operators to fight not only the weight and friction of the concrete they are striking off but also the force of gravity the lura screed eliminates that backbreaking labor we encourage contractors to use our system striking off going down hill and working with the force of gravity features & benefits productivity: with a lightweight design and enhanced features the lura screed enables striking off the pour traveling down the incline increasing productivity while decreasing crew sizes and maximizing profits uniformity: enhanced concrete uniformity will be evident with each use of the lura screed our roller screed systems mild compression leaves a smooth surface every time recommended by lura wet screed shoe: this feature allows crew to pour right next to wet concrete making the lura screed the only concrete roller screed that floats simply attach the wet screed shoe to the handle end in place of the wall plug and attach the ergonomic solid handle to give you total control for monolithic continuous or one day pours the wet screed shoe is irreplaceable center pin pivot and electric motor: certain applications such as retention ponds and water treatment ponds require a radius slope once a challenge that required placement by hand radius slopes are easy and efficient with the lura screed with the combination of our center pin pivot and electric motor contractors can use the roller screed to sweep sideways across the slope request a quote see our brochure innovation
3,wide concrete pouring screed large concrete pours large concrete slabs jobs you thought were impossible are just a screed away from possible wide pours the combination of the lura screed’s powerful gas motor and lightweight easy-to-use design make it the roller screed system of choice for large high volume pours with the flexible and customizable system included in our contractor package and additional extension tubes available for purchase the lura screed system easily manages concrete pours up to 40 feet wide while maintaining a precise and level concrete application there will be some deflection after 22 feet so in cases where a very flat pour is necessary wide pours are probably not the way to go however for some projects sloping or deflection isn’t going to affect the final outcome because of lura’s threaded axle system crews have the choice to power up both sides of the screed if necessary in order to tackle a large job quickly and efficiently features & benefits transportability: lura’s roller screed is lightweight and extremely portable it can be lifted by one man and transported in a truck without the need for an expensive job trailer versatility: the lura screeds patented threaded axle system accommodates any size of pour in a snap the individual sections can be combined to create the ideal lenh up to 40 feet recommended by lura tips for success: it’s important to remember that whenever possible operate your motor off the right side of the screed in doing so the natural action of the roller is always “tightening” those threads if you do move the motor to the left side use the t-handle wrench to adjust your set screws in this application the spinning of the screed will work to “loosen” the thread the set screw will ensure the screed connection stays firm and your crew should periodically check and tighten it as needed for pours wider than 24’ the lura team advises running a screed pipe down the middle of the pour to control any deflection request a quote see our brochure innovation
