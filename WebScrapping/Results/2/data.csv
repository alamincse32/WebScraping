case studiesclick the images below to enlarge the case studies esports faqhow many pcs does it take to start an esports teamthe games you are playing and the minimum required seats for a starting lineup: rocket league would be 3 league of legends and many other titles have 5 and overwatch 2 has 5 players you may want to consider doubling that number to have a “varsity” and “jv” lineup for each title so they can practice against each other in scrimmages during practiceshould i look at desktops or laptops for my esports teamthis really will depend on two factors first what are the available spaces for your programs facility if you do not have a permanent area for desktops to be housed laptops give you the flexibility to move from space to space or to store the machines during off hours for the program and free up the space for different uses during the day the second factor is if your team travels or plans to travel frequently to lan tournaments “bring your own computer” style events still happen and if your team plans to be on the road often laptops might be a better fit a desktop however will have more options for parts – both at the time of purchase and later if you wish

happening when i see a blinking green power supply status ledone blink per second means that the power supply is off or in cold redundancy cold redundancy means one power supply is in an efficient low-power state and it is not activated until it is neededwhat is happening when i see a blinking green system status ledit could be one of the following:the system has just had ac power appliedthe system is operating in a redundant state but with an impending failure for example two redundant power supplies are installed but one has failed is unplugged or is predicted to failthe system is in a degraded state the system is still functional but a non-critical temperature or voltage issue has occurredmemory configured as ras has failedmemory is transitioning to a warning statewhy are my fans running at high speedensure that:the power supply is firmly set into the power supply baythe connector to the power supply is securethe power cords are properly attached to the ac outletin case of using pedestal chassis make sure the top cover is properly seatedis the temperature of the room warm/hot the fans will automatically adjust speed to cool down the hardware as neededtry powering down and then powering back on the server fully a power fluctuation/surge could have tripped the fans into an error statedoes it really matter what kind of ups i use with my serversyes do not use a “simulated” or “stepped approximation to a sinewave” ups verify that the ups is a “pure” or “true” sinewave model use of simulated sinewave ups’ will result in entries in the error log excessive fan

43,3 ways password managers secure your digital life why password managers are the steel traps of data securityjun 22 2022 blogyou know how important passwords are for protecting your data but have you ever stopped to think how essential it is to protect your passwords toothat’s where a solution like password managers come in: “a tool that stores one strong master password that gives you easy access to all of your accounts while helping to keep cybercriminals at bay” explains nortonpassword managers are an effortless way to stay safe online not only do they keep all your different passwords organized in one place some also automatically generate strong unique passwords that cyberthieves can’t crackno more changing passwords slightly from account to account or using the dreaded 123456 as your login these gatekeepers are complex long and virtually un-guessablethis primer helps you optimize your password manager to better secure your dataa relatively new security innovationthis is not your grandmother’s code word password managers are usually run from an app or piece of computer software that safely houses your usernames and passwords for different sitesdepending on how they’re programmed randomized passwords may be auto-generated using a lenhy string of letters numbers symbols and capitalization the main draw is the password manager’s ability to designate unique strong passwords for each of your accounts this hub is usually encrypted and guarded with a single password passphrase or touch idpassword managers may be downloaded as an application installed as a browser plug-in or in some cases come standard with your device’s operating system the idea is to automatically capture and in some cases create a different complex password and username for every site you log in to enter the password vault you’ll create a randomized password using the best practices mentioned above – preferably one that’s updated every 90 daysthe pros of a password managerare you one of the 66% of people who use the same password for multiple accounts you’re not alone because the dozens of different passwords we use can be hard to keep track of many are happy to let password managers do the work for thempassword manager perks include:1 no more password memorization commit just one main password to memory and let your password manager handle the rest2 unique complex passwords for each of your accounts usually these are comprised of at least 12 random characters including lower and upper case letters numbers and symbols3 password encryption for added security sensitive data including passwords personal id numbers and credit card information is encrypted or “scrambled” making it virtually useless to hackers even if they do somehow crack your codea few things to keep in mindso if password managers are so great why do fewer than 15% of americans use themvulnerability: while password managers are one of the best most secure solutions available they’re not completely impenetrable or hack-proof most skeptics worry all their passwords could be stolen at once the good news is that many password managers are encrypted so even if a breach does occur the data should be virtually useless to the cybercrookuser error: forget or misplace your main password and you could be locked out of the rest of the information in your vaultsetup difficulties: there’s also a learning curve associated with password managers if it’s your first time setting one up you may need to pull from a database of passwords you previously created or manually enter them into the vaulteven with their shortcomings it’s easy to see why password managers are rapidly emerging as an essential component of our digital lives their popularity is expected to increase as the number of cyberthreats and accounts we have continue to escalate no wonder they’ve been endorsed by everyone from the federal trade commission ftc to the vast majority of cyber-security specialists like the sound of one password to unlock them all this is the way to do it – safelysearch our website search for: our productscaching and storagedesktop computersesports
