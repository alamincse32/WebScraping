View E-Rate Guide They Love Us, They Really Love Us! “ByteSpeed has great products, great service, and great people. It’s a total win-win, and I am honored to be able to work with ByteSpeed over the years.” – Rob DeMeuse, Mauston School District, Mauston, WI Read Other Lovenotes “Without a doubt, ByteSpeed support is #1. While we purchase only ByteSpeed servers in our district now, we have purchased servers from other companies in the past. As important as price is, they consistently give us a great deal on servers. If we run into any issues at all, their support team is quick to respond and are always able to resolve the problem for us. Getting price quotes is so painless with ByteSpeed. I ask for a quote and I receive it quickly without being hassled or pressured into purchasing. ByteSpeed is an all-around fantastic company to work with!” – Chuck Whiteley IIIIT Manager, Central Point School District 6, Oregon Read Other Lovenotes “Channelview ISD has been working with ByteSpeed for several years. After dealing with headaches from other vendors for years, we tested one of their NUCs out and were impressed by its performance, especially at that price. Then we heard about the 5 year desktop warranty and were sold. Since then, we purchase all ByteSpeed NUCs for our teacher and student desktops and plan to continue that in the future. ByteSpeed not only delivers on hardware and variety, but their customer service is top notch. You get a real live person on the phone when you call and we have developed relationships with several people there, which is often missing in other vendors. ByteSpeed, along with the NUCs, has helped us to be able to regularly replace machines to keep students and teachers up to date with their equipment and we couldn’t be happier about it.” – Darrell Cheney, Director of Technology, Channelview ISD, Channelview, TX Read Other Lovenotes “We made the decision to go with ByteSpeed because I really enjoy working with your company and you will bend over backwards to help us and make sure we are happy with our purchase! So thank you!” – Angie Aaseth, NRHEG Technology Coordinator, NRHEG School District, New Richland, MN Read Other Lovenotes “We’ve been with ByteSpeed for many years, and could not possibly be happier. ByteSpeed sells high quality products that have performed admirably for us. Also, their support and customer service is truly outstanding. Their staff is always helpful, knowledgeable, and courteous, which means a lot to us. As a Technology Coordinator for a school district, I can say that their 5-year desktop warranty on PCs is not the norm for the computer industry, but it sure makes my job a lot easier. We are very satisfied with our relationship with ByteSpeed. I highly recommend them, and give them the highest rating possible!” – Dusty Malena, Technology Coordinator, Booneville School District, Booneville, AR Read Other Lovenotes “I have been working with ByteSpeed since 2008. They have wonderful technical support and customer service. If you have a question they will help out in any way they can to resolve the problem. If you are looking for any kind of equipment and ByteSpeed may not carry what you are looking for, email and ask them. They have a wonderful sales team and will go and look for what you need and get you the best price. I will be using ByteSpeed for a very long time.” – Jory Schmidt, Technology Coordinator, Highmore-Harrold School District, Highmore, SD Read Other Lovenotes “ByteSpeed’s custom bulk packaging option is spectacular! Not only is there less waste, but it is much easier to get to the equipment. We would rather have that type of packaging for all my orders. Thanks so much!” – Tess Hill, Technology Coordinator, Switzerland of Ohio School District, Woodsfield, OH Read Other Lovenotes “I am just truly impressed with the great service and support we get from the folks at ByteSpeed. I don’t honestly think in all of the years I’ve been working in customer service fields I’ve received such wonderful service!” – Marc Stakey, Technology Coordinator, Bellefontaine City Schools, Bellefontaine, OH Read Other Lovenotes ByteSpeed Blog Check out our technology articles and advice, product videos, and more.
