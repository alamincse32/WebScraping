products tillage joker rx joker rxsince horsch introduced the first high speed compact disc concept to north america the joker series has become a necessary tool on many farms throughout the continent whether working in no-till minimum-till or conventional till farming practices the joker adds time-efficiency within the optimum agronomic work windows for residue management and precise seedbed preparation its proven advantages over vertical tillage tandem disc field cultivators and other shallow tillage concepts has revolutionized the north american tillage market the joker rx is a brand new joker platform which enhances performance while maintaining superior working action and tillage quality when coming up with this concept we wanted to increase throughput for variable field conditions while providing versatility and agility with a vertical tillage conversion being the pioneer and designing the first high speed compact disk in north america comes with responsibility to continue advancing and holding the highest rank we have started this in 2008 and have advanced that platform into the best yet 4th generation of joker - joker rx watch to learn more rollflex has evolved into the new ringflex system same finishing and working quality of rollflex with enhanced performance in variable field conditions new frame design utilizes pivot pins instead of poly bushings for easier servicing14% more distance between front and rear row of discs vs previous rt modelnew mono arm design is 66% longer for added through-put than previous rt model joker rx features monoarm a single blade per rubber torsion mounted arm with reliable minimum maintenance bearings which: maintain precise blade angle engagement during tillage operationcreates ideal uniform working horizon during seedbed preparationaggressively sizes and blends plant residues with a fine soil structure the optiroll packer option at rear of machine provides a firmed and uniform soil structure which: optimizes performance in variable soil conditionsincluding different soil types residue and tonesincorporates a poly-based center with rubber ribs and precision scraper combined provide superior cleaning in high moisture soil conditions joker rx series features 17 front/17 rear degree blade angles on monoarm that: provide uniform and thorough horizontal soil tilth during seedbed preparation maintains consistent soil engagement and draft in variable soil conditionscreates aggressive working action when sizing tough residues blade angle and mounting design ensures consistent soil engagement and provides uniform working action across the machine consistent thorough horizontal fracture creates uniform soil structure level working horizon and provides uniform mixing of sized residue and soil all foundations of an optimum seedbed uniform soil working action maximizes efficacy of pre-emerge herbicides thorough incorporation of granular fertilizers and manure while providing optimum seedbed soil structure residue utilization maximize the agronomic benefits of post-harvest residue by promoting accelerated decomposition intense residue sizing provides more “open doors” for soil bacteria and fungi to initialize the residue decomposition process unlock the nutrient and organic matter values remaining in post-harvest residues to benefit the nutritional needs of future crops promote healthy crop environment by rapidly decomposing residue that harbor pathogens and dangerous pests soil consolidation unique technique used during soil preparation that creates optimum seedbed environment consolidation promotes capillary affect in the soil which uniformly draws and maintains moisture in the seedbed and seed zone uniform moisture in the seed zone ensures rapid seedling germination and uniform emergence which are two key principals to establishing maximum yield potentials joker rx creates a consistent firm soil structure across the working width of the machine which optimizes seed placement performance of planters and seeders it provides optimum soil to residue contact which aids in accelerating residue decomposition joker rx versus traditional vertical tillagel vertical tillage vs r joker rx the joker rx incorporates and promotes decomposition for release of valuable plant nutrients vs loss to wind and water while providing a perfect working horizon across working width of machine joker rx versus traditional vertical tillage concept:the joker provides more aggressive residue sizing and thorough mixing of residue within the soil creating an aerobic environment suited for residue decompositionthe joker sizes and mixes residue thoroughly in consolidated soil to help it decompose more rapidly this releases n-p-k and micronutrients and increases organic matter levels for future croppingthe sized and mixed residue within the consolidated soil is stable with less chance of movement by nature wind and water in contrast vertical tillage systems generally leave the nutrient-rich residue on the surface to blow away left joker rx - right vertical tillage joker rx versus traditional tandem/offset disk:the joker provides a much smoother field finish compared to the ridges lumps slabbing and uneven depth of traditional diskswith the joker there is no need for multiple passes to “clean up the mess” of a rough uneven fieldhigher tillage speeds and more action in one pass allows the joker to be overall more efficient without sacrificing tillage quality advantages the joker rx series high-speed compact disc makes an ideal precision tool for both primary tillage and secondary tillage since it’s pioneering of the high-speed compact disc in the north american market the joker has proven to be not only a very versatile tool in many cropping situations but also necessary tool when working in adverse conditionsadvantages in primary tillage applicationsrecondition and level fields after harvest as a

high ratio of fine earth in the seed row and the placement of the seed in a so-called “open furrow” the seed coulter forms a furrow and removes clods and organic matter from the seed horizon the seed is placed into this furrow and is fixed by the press wheel in the wet soil thus an excellent emergence is achieved even in extreme climatic conditions sowing can be carried out either in cultivated or in uncultivated soil the machine is optimum for no-till farming sprinter 11 nt / sprinter 12 nt / sprinter 15 nt the sprinter 11 nt 12 nt and 15 nt excel due to a 3-section frame concept that allows for a quick folding when changing fields and makes the machine a compact seed drill for large fields with low horsepower requirement the sprinter family guarantees a high clearance between frame and surface as well as between the seed coulters and thus is ideal as a direct seed drill the individually controlled tine seed coulters place up to 3 components in an individually adjusted seed horizon

maestro maestro sv 3800 getting a crop planted at the correct time at the correct depth and in the correct environment are the fundamental keys in setting a stage for maximum yield potential these are the key fundamentals that maestro row crop planter technology are based on technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield a complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence this is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting the maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials we use three terms to describe this unit - simple robust precise conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders the proven airvac metering system of the maestro sv ensures precise population control superior singulation and ultra accurate seed spacing maestro sv the maestro sv provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today with hydraulic downforce weight transfer simplistic metering large capacity and the lightest footprint in the industry the maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise watch to learn more for spring planted crops no matter where in the world there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials if crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility seed variety or planter brand but simply because of the calendar the maestro sw planter chassis is designed with this in mind capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time pending seedbed conditions planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window seed placement precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields both positive and negative placing each seed at a proper depth into moisture and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence this is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures experience delayed emergence and fall behind in yield potential precise seed placement is a full system approach in the maestro sv to place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar the weight transfer system on the maestro sv distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar thus stabilizing it with each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle advantages complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day precision seed placement along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil

the key fundamentals that maestro row crop planter technology are based on technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield a complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence this is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting the maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials we use three terms to describe this unit - simple robust preciseconversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylindersa large diameter tire provides a superior footprint for excellent flotation while virtually eliminating pinch rows the proven airvac metering system of the maestro sv ensures precise population control superior singulation and ultra accurate seed spacing maestro sv the maestro sv provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today with hydraulic downforce weight transfer simplistic metering large capacity and the lightest footprint in the industry the maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise watch to learn more for spring planted crops no matter where in the world there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials if crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility seed variety or planter brand but simply because of the calendar the maestro sw planter chassis is designed with this in mind capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time pending seedbed conditions planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window seed placement precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields both positive and negative placing each seed at a proper

maestro maestro sv 8800 getting a crop planted at the correct time at the correct depth and in the correct environment are the fundamental keys in setting a stage for maximum yield potential these are the key fundamentals that maestro row crop planter technology are based on technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield a complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence this is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting the maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials we use three terms to describe this unit - simple robust preciseconversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylindersa large diameter tire provides a superior footprint for excellent flotation while virtually eliminating pinch rows the proven airvac metering system of the maestro sv ensures precise population control superior singulation and ultra accurate seed spacing maestro sv the maestro sv provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today with hydraulic downforce weight transfer simplistic metering large capacity and the lightest footprint in the industry the maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise watch to learn more for spring planted crops no matter where in the world there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials if crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility seed variety or planter brand but simply because of the calendar the maestro sv planter chassis is designed with this in mind capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time pending seedbed conditions planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window seed placement precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields both positive and negative placing each seed at a proper depth into moisture and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence this is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures experience delayed emergence and fall behind in yield potential precise seed placement is a full system approach in the maestro sv to place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar the weight transfer system on the maestro sv distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar thus stabilizing it with each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle advantages complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day precision seed placement along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil structurelargest seed / fertilizer carrying capacities available in the market todayup to 249 bushel seed carrying capacity pending model up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity pending modelglobal industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives weight transfer and hydraulic downforce technologies electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting individual row shutoff and curve compensationchassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprintlightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires large footprint low tire psilight soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth controlmore high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the marketisobus implement control allows use of industry or horsch virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks row unit composition the horsch maestro sv utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance low maintenance and low wear characteristics several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise consistent perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady and the seed release tried and true industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows along with stabilizing the toolbar this feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required this technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down also when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the autoforce system the hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies by creating a smooth ride singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placementco capacity the maestro sv series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity 166/249 bushel seed 725/1225 gallon liquid contributes to more time planting and less time filling available with the maestro sw deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity the maestro sv planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters by maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity maestro sv secures maximum yield potentials graph is based on a maestro sw 2430 liquid planter to competitive 24 row 30 inch planters on average factory offered capacities comparison is at 75 mph average planting speed with 30 minute fill times furrow integrity maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential if soil structure is restrictive the crop yield is restricted the maestro sw uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts especially in wet planting seasons eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in

planting to the next level for spring planted crops no matter where in the world there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials if crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility seed variety or planter brand but simply because of the calendar the maestro sp planter chassis is designed with this in mind capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time pending seedbed conditions planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window seed placement precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields both positive and negative placing each seed at a proper depth into moisture and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence this is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures experience delayed emergence and fall behind in yield potential precise seed placement is a full system approach in the maestro sp to place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar the weight transfer system on the maestro sp distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar thus stabilizing it with each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle furrow integrity maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential if soil structure is restrictive the crop yield is restricted the maestro sp uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts especially in wet planting seasons eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in the field advantages complete concept for maximizing planted

seed carrying capacity pending model up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity pending modelglobal industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives weight transfer and hydraulic downforce technologies electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting individual row shutoff and curve compensationchassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprintlightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires large footprint low tire psilight soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth controlmore high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the marketisobus implement control allows use of industry or horsch virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders row unit composition the horsch maestro sp utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance low maintenance and low wear characteristics several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise consistent perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady and the seed release tried and true industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows along with stabilizing the toolbar this feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required this technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down also when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the autoforce system the hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies by creating a smooth ride singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placement capacity the maestro sp series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity 166/249 bushel seed 725/1225 gallon liquid contributes to more time planting and less time filling available with the maestro sp deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity the maestro sp planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters by maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity maestro sp secures maximum yield potentials graph is

pressure controlautoforce – what do you need an automatic coulter pressure control forstony soils require more coulter pressure to place the seed at a consistent depth if the coulter pressure is too low the coulter body would not move smoothly and the seed would germinate irregularly and with different speedlight conditions or pressure-sensitive soils need less coulter pressure so that the soil is not compacted too much coulter pressure compacts the soil and slows down the development of the roots although all seed was placed at the same depththere rarely are fields that are completely even the coulter pressure has to be adapted to each section of the fieldthis is why horsch developed an automatic coulter pressure control systemhow does autoforce work on the soilthe contact pressure of the row is measured with a sensor at the two support wheels this pressure = nominal value is previously set in the terminal you can choose between three pressure levels 25 kg – 50 kg and 80 kg the values can also be adapted individuallywith changing soil conditions the row needs more or less power to be able to keep up the set placement depth the contact pressure would change the sensor detects this and the system regulates the contact pressure in such a way that it always corresponds to the nominal value that has been set this is possible due to the design of the machine which allows for transferring weight to the seed barthe coulter pressure automatically varies between 150 kg and 350 kg thus the grain is always embedded at the same level a too shallow placement as well as soil compaction can thus be avoided autoforce pressure sensor: weight recording is carried out via piezo pressure sensor technology details of the piezo sensor downloadcenter spare parts contact sales

farm 2023 field days event horsch shop more company search futureground testimonials horsch llc service testimonials hooked on horsch brent hager located near rugby north dakota brent hager grows corn and soybeans with his father and two employees hager is the proud owner of a panther 6015 the model number of this product has since changed to the panther 460 maestro 2430 and joker pt400 you could say he became hooked on horsch in 2012 when he purchased his first piece of horsch equipment and has been adding to his fleet ever since his first experience with horsch however happened in 2011 on a side job when he was custom spraying for another farmeri was spraying some wheat ground that was custom seeded with a horsch drill and it caught my eye said hager a few days later i was spraying next to another field seeded by a horsch it was a wet spring and there was just perfect emergence out of that drillthe timing worked well because hager was in the market for something new our old drill was starting to get used up said hager after looking at those fields i knew i had to start looking at the panther seriously i owned one the next spring in his first year of owning the panther hager used it to drill wheat soybeans and corn before he later adopted a pure corn/soybean rotation he couldnt have asked for better results our wheat stand was perfect we drilled beans in 30-inch paired rows and they were some of the best wed ever grown they consistently yield 2-3 bushels more than our 30-inch rows the corn we planted with the panther was very successful too he saidthe panther also works extremely well in hagers wet conditions i can get back in the field one to two days sooner after a big rain event compared to competitor drills he said i attribute that to the wide tire press wheels that shed mud and have a light footprint having no disks or gauge wheels to plug is also a huge plusin 2013 he expanded his horsch lineup with the joker pt400 which he uses on his corn stalks in the fall to manage the tough residue he also runs it over his sloughs to help dry out the wet ground hager said i used to be strictly no-till but we just cant do it anymore with our wet springs it does a beautiful job and rarely plugs it leaves a great seed bed in the springthe following season he added one more piece of horsch equipment with the maestro seed cost and harvest ability were the main factors in going with a conventional planter instead of my air seeder for corn he saidin addition to using the planter for corn he also plants some soybean acres on triangular shaped fields where the maestros individual section control eliminates double planting ive owned almost every other type of planter before and this one by far has been the superior planter said hager in my opinion its the only planter on the marketalong the way hager has received a lot of help from his dealer butler machinery in devils lake north dakota butler has been very good to work with he said they always have parts on hand and their service department is second to nonehager also gives a lot of credit to the people at horsch jesse territory manager and trent product specialist have been a hugepart of my success he said horsch has a great productline but when you have two guys like that along with a great dealer it gives you a lot of confidence going into a new product bill darrinon persia ia iowa farmer adds joker to tackle tough terrain bill darrinon persia iowa — when it comes to residue management the job of a corn-on-corn farmer is tougher than most it’s even harder for farmers like bill darrinon who are at odds with managing their heavy residue while trying to conserve moisture and prevent erosion as much as possible this spring however darrinon decided to stack the deck more in his favor with a new horsch joker rt330since he’s based in persia iowa many might assume darrinon is blessed with ideal corn growing conditions but that isn’t necessarily the case “we don’t have typical iowa weather” he says “our weather patterns are more similar to nebraska we’re likely to dry out every july and august so we aren’t allowed the luxuries of people with frequent rains”the contour is equally challenging “we don’t have rolling hills — we’re rolling things over” jokes darrinon alluding to the fact that 20-percent slopes in his fields are common additionally the soil types on darrinon’s farm vary as greatly as the terrain from light soils on windblown hilltops to sticky gumbo in the missouri river bedspreviously darrinon owned a couple of disks that he used for tillage although these tools aren’t designed for water conservation or erosion control he limited their use to one pass in the fall trying to keep the negative effects of disking to a minimum he wasn’t necessarily pleased with the performance of the disksthough they blended residue inconsistently and produced a rough field finish preventing him from achieving ideal seed placement at planting timeto better suit his needs darrinon wanted to switch to strip till methods he felt this would allow him to prevent moisture loss and erosion while giving him a clean seedbed free of root balls for planting however the slopes thwarted his hopes since it is virtually impossible for him to maintain straight lines across such steep hillsides but rather than reverting back to the disks darrinon devised another strategy to achieve the desired results “i wanted a shallow tillage tool that pinned residue close to the ground so that the trash sweeps on my planter could efficiently move the residue to the side” he saysworking closely with sorensen equipment his trusted dealer from harlan iowa darrinon determined that a joker could be a good fit for him the joker has two rows of 20-inch-diameter notched discs that are angled for aggressive residue chopping and incorporation at working depths between one and five inches it also includes the roll-flex finishing tool which consolidates the tilled surface to prevent moisture loss reduce erosion concerns and produce a smooth consistent seedbed for planting these benefits make the unit better suited for darrinon’s dry hilly farmland than the tools he was usingso darrinon requested a demo and successfully tested the unit on his toughest soils — the river bed gumbo although the joker seemed to excel during the demo darrinon wasn’t quite ready to pull the trigger “ultimately planting is the most important activity a farmer does” he says “so i didn’t purchase a joker until i had a chance to plant behind it” however everything worked exactly as hoped the joker chopped the corn residue and consolidated it in the top couple inches of soil so that the planter’s pneumatic trash wheels running at 20 psi down pressure could effectively sweep the root balls to the side away from where the seed was placed even darrinon’s friend who had many years of experience farming the river bed was impressed at the joker’s performance “he said there was no way the joker would work in the gumbo but it did” darrinon saysafter receiving delivery of his own 33-foot joker rt330 in may 2015 darrinon immediately put it to work breaking one of his personal rules of tillage “i don’t like spring tillage because we get that much more erosion” he saysnonetheless his crew hit the ground running with the joker operating it up to 13 miles per hour and covering as much as 1100 acres in just three days “it’s amazing how many acres you can run over at 13 miles per hour” says darrinon who is used to his old disks operating at only five miles per hour “one person with the joker can get more done than two people with two disks that’s a great benefit since good experienced farm labor is hard to find”along with its speed in the field the joker also proved to offer quick maintenance “you can grease this tool in just a few minutes” says darrinon “every aspect of the joker is efficient”additionally some of the fields he covered this year were especially tough due to challenging spring weather in his area in fact some of the missouri river beds had overgrown with weeds including water hemp as high as five feet nonetheless one pass with the joker through the wet ground was able to knock it down well enough for darrinon to successfully plant into it no other tillage tool could have done it“ he saysgoing forward darrinon hopes he can revert back to his tillage routine doing just one pass with the joker in the fall he’s also excited to continue improving the condition of his seedbeds so that the soybeans which make up a small portion of his operation can be harvested more efficiently with flex headers “the joker leaves a very smooth level surface” says darrinon “you can immediately feel the difference and in the next two years we hope to get our fields more level than they’ve ever been before”additionally darrinon stands by his decision to use the joker instead of following the vertical tillage trend “i find the vertical tillage movement confusing” he says “the residue just lays there and when the wind blows you’ve got ditches full of corn stalks”not to mention he feels that the lines are a bit blurred between traditional disk sand vertical tillage “if you can’t tell if it’s vertical tillage or a disk it’s a disk” he says despite other trends in tillage darrinon feels confident in the new tillage concept that his joker rt330 offers “disks look the same as they did 30 years ago” he says “but the joker is a new generation of tillage” i agree to external content being loaded allow external

sitzenhof adjacent to the fitcentre and the factory premises of the horsch maschinen gmbh it comprises demonstrative experiments as well as special tests with regard to various questions and problems the test fields were established in 1997 and since then have been used to exchange experiences with farmers and to answer agricultural questionsthe fields are divided into a 135 hectare demonstration area and a 65 hectare trial plot up to 300 plots 3 m wide 50 m long can be established in this generous demo garden in the front fields a long-term test concerning cultivation intensity has been put in place this test has been running since the establishment of the demo garden and covers all sectors from intensive tillage with plough or deep cultivation over minimum tillage to direct seedingthe remaining plots are used to try and explain various questions regarding cultivation and sowingsoilthe rock material present at the site sitzenhof is shell limestone which was formed from fossil calcareous deposits approx 243 to 235 million years ago the soil type is brown earth that resulted from a browning and a simultaneous enrichment with humus of the top soil in a humid climate the soil texture is sandy loam with a clay content of 25 per centa specific characteristic of the site are the changing soil conditions with soil points ranging between 28 and 42 and the high ratio of stonesin this region traditional farming with commercial crops as well as livestock farming is prominent the agricultural fields in the region and at the site sitzenhof are used for the cultivation of cereals and rape that are marketed traditionally and for the cultivation of cereals grain maize and maize for silage for the use in livestock farming and for energy production in biogas plantsclimatethe demo garden is situated in the warm temperate rain zone of the medium latitudes in the transition zone from the western european maritime climate to the eastern european continental climate with a slight tendency towards the continental one that is marked by colder winters and hotter summers with less humiditythis tendency is supported by the average annual temperature of 75°c which is 09°c lower than the german annual average with a medium annual rainfall of about 670 mm in the observation period gut sitzenhof is slightly below the german annual average during the past five years rainfall has settled down clearly above 700 mm per yearlong-term testthe long-term test “cultivation intensity“ that was put in place in 1997 first and foremost serves to observe the annual effects of different cultivation types the resulting findings are used to evaluate the different initial situations for cultivationthe test results can be summarised as follows:cultivation intensity depends on several factors the main factors are the type of crop the condition of the soil before cultivation compaction tracks and the moisture at the time of cultivationthe results show the tendency that in many years deep loosening brings about yield benefitsthe maximum loosening depth depends on the thickness of the topsoil at the site sitzenhof max up to 20 cm then it gives way to the subsoil; on deeper sites loosening at a depth of 35 – 40 cm can be reasonable; on shallow stony sites the maximum loosening depth often is limited to 10 to 15 cmloosening depth cannot be generalised but has to be adapted specifically for every site every crop and the humidity of the soilbasically a certain degree of cultivation guarantees a good yield; at the site sitzenhof direct seeding results in lower yields especially for winter rapepossible savings in cultivation start with consequently avoiding compactions and tracksunderground fertilisation compared to wide spread fertilisation considerably supports the young population in difficult years and thus can have important advantages for the population development eg under the extremely wet conditions of the autumn sowing of winter rape in 2010also from the economical point of view cultivation intensity is an important parameter to optimise unit costs but also from this point of view only yields at a constantly high level guarantee good farm profitssince 2003 the experiences with regard to cultivation at the site sitzenhof have been completed by an extremely heavy site in the czech republic east of prague this second site will be presented on the occasion of the practical field days 2011 and the experiences we made there will be discussed downloadcenter spare parts contact sales partner arrange a demonstration futureground

contributes to a healthy climate on earth prepare the soil for a healthy exchange what if we are facing a shortage of food that is caused by the climate what if we are facing a shortage of food that is caused by the climatein the 2022 digital fireside chat michael horsch together with josef braun organic farmer from freising and deert rieve runs a conventional agricultural farm in stralsund discusses the climatic consequences on the production of staple foods it basically is about the increasing influences of the climate on farming and agricultural production because of the crop failures caused by weather extremes the prices for rape soya maize but also for cereals have risen considerably canada for example was hit by a heat wave at the beginning of june in china the flooding of the yanze led to considerable crop failures according to statistics it was one of the biggest climate-induced damages as it mainly hit the “breadbaskets” of china in addition the prices are still influenced by covid-19 the current commodity prices and the increased freight charges however there could be another reason for the situation in the market: namely the influence of a shortage of staple foods based on this assumption the discussion starts with the question if farming should completely be converted to organic farming or if there also are other problems and solutionsaccording to josef braun organic farming at least is the correct approach if you take climate protection and wildlife conservation into account: “if we want to cope with these challenges we have to rethink the use of the land” in the future too land use has to meet the requirements of nature and man the productivity of prime locations has to be maintained deert rieve too agrees and adds: “we cannot afford a yield reduction on prime locations” in braun’s opinion the “agro-forest” method also is a good approach the principle of this method is to integrate trees and bushes in the fields they thus lead to an improvement of the gross photosynthesis output a reduced drawdown of the groundwater and they create better conditions for higher yields but according to rieve this has to happen without continuing to lose additional arable land from an ecological and economic point of view it is important to maintain the prime locations “we could reforest unproductive land where the negative consequences of a production caused by higher specific crop care measures are more serious” deert rieve points outall three speakers agree that our eating habits too as well as the high amount of wasted food play a major role according to statistics 1/3 of the food that is produced all over the world is wasted 42% of it legumes 22% cereals 5% meat 18% potatoes but only 1% seafood figures according to michael horsch “you see there is a causal relationship: the more expensive a product is the less often it is wasted“ horsch says in his opinion the advantage of high prices also is that less food is wasted and that we start to think more about how we feed ourselves so finally crooked fruits and vegetables have found their way into our supermarkets “however we must not forget the negative consequences for the third world these people often can only afford bread and if the bread price doubles because of the increasing wheat price there really will be a big problem” horsch states international trade however is able to compensate globally for crop failures according to rieve countries that for different reasons – either climate or others – cannot produce themselves can be supplied from other locations and compensate for shortfalls he considers it a major responsibility to support each other and to find solutions together downloadcenter spare parts contact sales partner arrange a
