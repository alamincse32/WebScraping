performance and durability improvements spacer: stainless steel spacer features a roll formed design to provide maximum area for primary and secondary sealant coverage it provides increased resistance to condensation and less stress on the ig seal system no polymer content minimizes the risk of chemical fogging primary seal: polyisobutylene pib minimizes moisture permeation is uv resistant and provides an outstanding argon barrier desiccants: beaded molecular sieve provides initial frost points below -65°f desiccant assures optimum moisture adsorption while minimizing the effects of temperature-related pressure changes secondary seal: specially formulated silicone provides long-term adhesion withstands uv exposure and provides excellent durability when exposed to moisture

a hassle taking up valuable time and labor even worse damaged glass must be reordered and replaced preserve solves this job-site dilemma because the film is applied at the factory construction crews do not waste time applying and removing protective coverings such as tapes films or sprays other makeshift fixes like newspaper or cardboard are also avoided since they block out lightpreserve is clear so natural light still shines into the interior of the structure preserve saves you time money and a lot of hassle without preserve glass generally requires at least two heavy-duty cleanings

translates into a 02% seal failure rate over twenty years plainly the lowest in the industry to compare a vintage organically sealed ig unit—still regularly used in new windows today—has an 84% failure rate after 20 years even modern competitive spacer systems simply cannot match the long-term durability characteristics of xl edge enhanced thermal performance xl edge improves window u-factor by as much as 003 compared to an identical configuration using an aluminum spacer with our advanced loē coatings xl edge renders outstanding thermal performance these benefits make all the difference in compliance with local energy codes if your marketing plan includes the energy star® windows program xl edge can be effective in qualifying more of your window and door configurations the warm-edge characteristics of xl edge ig reduce the frequency and amount of condensation during extreme temperature conditions for a typical wood/vinyl window design it would have to be 12°f colder outside before condensation forms on a unit with xl edge in comparison with aluminum low failures mean long-term success compare your ig seal failure rate with the 02% failure rate of xl edge ig over time conventional ig units are increasingly prone to failure the longer the warranty period the more your profits may be eroded but not with xl edge–your windows last longer your customers stay happy and your profits are preserved this is illustrated in the following chart assuming a $500 service call to replace a failed ig unit under warranty and with an 8% seal failure rate the window manufacturer would need to add $40 to the cost of the window to cover warranty costs with a 02% seal failure rate the window manufacturer would only need to add $125 to the window to cover warranty claims warranty costs vs field failure rate xl edge facts cardinal fabricates over 20 million ig units annually with eleven ig facilities in the us to accommodate any level of demand always on time loē coatings tempering lamination internal grilles and bars and custom shapes and sizes are all available as options cardinal ig company offers electronic order processing and logistics services for the demands of

heat-strenhened or tempered in some configurations heat-strenhening may be recommended to mitigate against the effects of thermal stress performance matters the design of a window or door requires a careful selection of materials like the sash frame decorative bars as well as the glass all of these pieces can affect the total performance values of a completed product therefore some glazing options can be more advantageous for particular designs over others with loē-di89 glass the advantage lies in the combination of a very high solar heat gain coefficient shgc and a very low u-factor

loē²-240® and loē³-340® glass are the ideal solution with unparalleled solar performance and optimum glare protection loē²-240 and loē³-340 keep the sun in its place the result maximum comfort and great views even on the warmest of days loē²-240 is an excellent overall performer for climates where the sun is constantly on the offensive as a specially formulated two-layer coating many opt for loē²-240 for its great solar performance and gentle gray hue our newest triple-layer loē³-340 simply has no equal for reducing solar heat gainits shgc of 018 slashes the sun’s thermal energy and wherever glare is a problem loē³-340 keeps it in checkloē³-340 delivers the lowest uv blocking of any loē glass we offer this greatly reduces fading on furniture carpet drapes and everything inside the home control the glare too much sunlight makes it difficult to see this can cause problems like eye strain headaches and overall discomfort furthermore solar glare can make it hard to use computer screens televisions and electronic devices loē²-240 and loē³-340 glass have special anti-glare properties that allow sufficient visible light through without being excessive no need to use drapes or blinds which otherwise diminish the visual benefit of windows in the first place glare control comparisons glare control glass rejects most solar heat controls glare rooms stay cool comfy and attractive grey tinted glass cuts sunlight by 50% but poor solar heat control glass temperatures can exceed 100°f clear glass transmits 80% of solar energy no glare control no protection blinds

a dual pane unit which allows more energy from the sun to enter the home while the low u-factor keeps the heat in loē-di89 is available in a variety of custom shapes and sizes and can be heat-strenhened or tempered in some configurations heat-strenhening may be recommended to mitigate against the effects of thermal stress performance matters the design of a window or door requires a careful selection of materials like the sash frame decorative bars as well as the glass all of these pieces can affect the total performance values of a completed product therefore some glazing options can be more advantageous for particular designs over others with loē-di89 glass the advantage lies in the combination of a very high solar heat gain coefficient shgc and a very low u-factor the high shgc allow more passive heat from the sun to enter the home and the low u-factor helps retain heat within the home’s interior ig type and coating clear 180esc 180esc i89 clear di89 visible

option for contemporary buildings we fabricate the glass for maximum safety and attractiveness newest performance requirements in the past handrail manufacturers designed rail systems with monolithic tempered glass while tempered is stronger than annealed glass the problem of fallout damage still exists in the rare event of glass breakage since 2015 code requirements from the international building code stipulate the use of tempered or heat-strenhened laminated glass in most railing applications cardinal’s laminated glass meets this code and is an excellent choice for railings in structural glass applications exposed edge laminates floors and stairs with high performance structural interlayers railings with cardinal laminated glass are built to withstand the most intense impacts this is due to their post-breakage strenh high film shear strenh and edge stability that other glass types do not offer fight moisture damage when selecting laminated glass it is vital to consider the application for an indoor railing structural pvb is suitable due to having great structural and post breakage performance at room temperaturesin outdoor scenarios interlayers like sentryglas® and structrual pvbs eg saflex dg41 are ideal this is due to their increased structural and post-breakage properties over a wide range of temperatures and superior edge stability framed and frameless railings cardinal laminated glass can be utilized in both framed and frameless railing applications framed glass railings are often used for a luxury appearance while being budget friendly they can be installed easily in inside and outside environments and feature handrails and posts framed glass railings frameless railings are highly desirable due to their ultra-modern look when

manufacturing centers and when paired with a sealed ig unit cardinal’s laminated glass renders even greater sound dampening stc and oitc are standards that measure sound attenuation widely used stc sound transmission class measures frequencies from 125 hz to 4000 hz oitc outdoor-indoor transmission class is a more modern and “real world” test that includes sounds on the lower end of the spectrum from 80 to 4000 hz in both cases the higher the number the better the sound deadening effects strict performance testing note how glass thickness and interlayer configurations affect sound control
