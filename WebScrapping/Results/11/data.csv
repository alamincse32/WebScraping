49,energy efficient windows and doors marvin energy efficient windows & doors energy-efficient windows can help reduce your utility bills and make your home more comfortablemarvin offers a variety of window and door options that help you achieve long-term performance and energy cost savings in any climate energy efficiency overview energy star glass & glazing performance cta here energy efficiency basics i need new windows what’s the first thing i need to know when it comes to windows and energy efficiency replacing windows with energy-efficient ones can help reduce your utility bills but the benefits go much further choosing energy-efficient windows makes your home more comfortable as their performance determines how much heat comes in and escapes out through the windows how do i know if a window or a door is energy efficient certification programs such as those administered by the national fenestration rating council nfrc and energy star provide ratings designed to indicate a window or door’s efficiency various performance ratings – like u-factor and solar heat gain coefficient – measure a product’s effectiveness in insulating and blocking heat from the sun among other things see the glossary of terms are tax credits still available for energy-saving window and door replacement tax credit programs change often to stay up-to-date with the latest visit wwwenergystargov/about/federal_tax_credits here is a link to the marvin manufacturers certification statement u-factor simply put u-factor measures how well a window keeps heat inside your home it’s a measure of total heat flow through a window or door from room air to outside air lower numbers indicate greater insulating capabilities it’s a particularly important measure for climates with colder winters solar-heat gain if u-factor denotes how much heat leaves your home the solar heat gain coefficient shgc measures how much radiant heat enters your home all you really need to remember is: the lower the number the less heat a window lets in visible transmittance the amount of visible light transferred through a window low e coatings can reject solar heat gain without significant reduction to visible light passing through the glass energy star© hear builder matt risinger explain how the energy star program can help you maximize comfort and energy efficiency by selecting windows and doors suited to your climate zone energy star’s u-factor is a number indicating how well the product insulates to maintain interior temperatures what does it mean to be an energy star-certified window or door to obtain energy star certification a window or door must meet a set of requirements that are determined by the us government those requirements differ based on geography meaning a window that’s being installed in minnesota has different requirements than one in florida the certification is meant to indicate that the window is energy-efficient in the region where it will be used and can help homeowners save on energy costs energy star criteria zone window u-factor window shgc door u-factor door shgc skylight u-factor skylight shgc northern ≤ 022 = 023 = 024 = 025 = 026 ≥ 017 ≥

prescriptive value does my window need to be energy star certified in order to be energy efficient no while an energy star label can be helpful in identifying energy-efficient windows every home is unique energy star provides a one-size-fits-all guideline but does not take into consideration for example the orientation of the house or the number or size of windows and associated solar heat gain a window expert like your marvin dealer can help determine which products will work best for you energy star also recognizes products that meet high energy-efficiency guidelines marvin offers the industry’s widest selection of wood and clad wood products that meet these rigorous criteria glazing description climate energy performance low e1 features a single layer of metallic coating which blocks heat loss to the outside while reflecting heat back into the room northern low u-factor high solar heat gain low e2 features a double layer of silver on an inside surface of ig glass it provides year round performance and comfort this coating option provides better protection against radiant heat transfer than single layer metallic low e coatings northern north-central south-central low u-factor medium solar heat gain low e3 features three layers of metallic silver and provides the lowest solar heat gain performance in climates where sun exposure is intense and cooling costs are high northern north-central south-central southern lower u-factor lower solar heat gain low ers a high performance insulating glass that features a low-e coating on the room-side glass 4th surface and low e3 on the 2nd glass surface northern north-central south-central southern superior u-factor lower solar heat gain glass & glazing can you help me to better understand the numbers what’s a good u-factor number what’s a good shgc different homeowners seek out different levels of efficiency but a “good” u-factor is <30 a “good” solar heat gain rating meanwhile on a scale from 0 to 1 is relative to climates in different regions low shgc numbers are best for southern climates where there’s intense sun exposure whereas higher shgc values make the most sense for regions with cold winters can you explain low e coatings the ability of a material to radiate energy heat is called its emissivity extremely thin coatings of special low emissivity low e metallic material are applied to glass panes used in windows and doors to boost their energy efficiency low e coatings usually applied to the inside layers of insulating glass manage the amount of light and heat either conducted through a window or reflected away from it are triple pane windows the best the more panes the better right not always triple-pane windows work best when enhanced energy performance is a key objective tripane offers a range of low-e configurations for greater solar heat gain control including panes filled with argon or krypton-argon gas for added efficiency but no matter how many panes there are if the window is poorly constructed poorly installed or allows air leakage it will not be efficient insulating glass ig two or more glass panes separated by energy efficient inert gas or air to reduce thermal transfer low e low e stands for low emissivity microscopically thin transparent metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a glass surface suppress radiative heat flow and reflect interior infrared energy heat back to the inside reducing heat loss through the glass various low e coating options can manipulate heat gain to match different climate needs gas fills argon or krypton mixes slow the movement of warm and cool air in ig airspaces and improve thermal performance tripane glazing energy efficiency is achieved through the use of various window technologies low e coatings frame materials glazing types spacers gas fill and weatherstripping all contribute to efficient windows energy ratings for windows and doors are certified by the national fenestration rating council nfrc

55,window and door maintenance: cleaning care painting and more marvin marvin support caring for your windows caring for your windows and doors care and maintenance maintenance checklist cleaning wood surfaces cta here maintenance checklist annual window and door maintenance checklist regular maintenance will help keep your marvin windows and doors operating smoothly use this checklist as an annual maintenance reminder make sure the weatherstrip is still effective if not call your local marvin dealer examine the windows interior and exterior finishes occasional repair to a damaged finish may be necessary don’t let paints stains and varnishes come in contact with the weatherstrip solvents can damage the weatherstrip’s performance trim any old loose caulking and seal any gaps with an appropriate high quality caulk occasionally an excess of silicone sealant called “squeeze-out” appears around the edge of the glass you can safely scrape off “squeeze-out” with a plastic putty knife without damaging the weather-tightness of your window or door make sure all exposed hardware screws are tightened securely apply a dry lubricant to the windows’ gears to keep them operating smoothly clean sand dirt or dust from door and window hinges sills and tracks check energy panels and storm and screen combinations to make sure screws and turn buttons are securely fastened check doors for smooth operation note: wood doors require a stabilization period after installation sometimes taking up to a year to adjust to humidity levels and other environmental factors location plays an important role in how often you should clean and maintain the exterior of aluminum clad windows and doors a coastal home exposed to harsh elements may need cleaning four or five times a year while in a drier climate once or twice a year may be sufficient safety precautions be careful when using ladders wear protective eyewear and clothing when working with primers paints stains cleaning solutions etc follow all manufacturers instructions for safe use and disposal cleaning how to clean glass avoid cleaning glass while it is in direct sunlight especially tinted and coated surfaces to prevent streaking start cleaning windows at the top of the building and continue to lower levels soak the glass surface with clean water to loosen dirt and debris make sure no abrasive particles remain on the glass then apply an approved cleaning solution with a non-abrasive cloth or other applicator quickly remove the cleaning solution with a squeegee taking care not to allow metal parts of cleaning equipment to touch the glass surface avoid any cleaning product that has a strong chemical base or a high alcohol content as chemical reactions could damage components wipe any remaining traces of cleaning solution from glass and other parts of the window and frame windows including their parts and frames are susceptible to deterioration if left damp some windows have an energy panel often confused with a storm window an energy panel is a removable exterior glass panel and can be cleaned in the same way as other parts of the window don’t use abrasive cleaning solutions or materials don’t allow metal parts of cleaning equipment to touch the glass and don’t use scrapers of any kind note: glass scratched by a scraper is not covered under the marvin warranty how to remove labels from glass labels and adhesive residue should be removed from glass as soon as possible after installation if a label does not release from the glass easily use an approved cleaning solution to help remove it do not remove labels while exposed to direct sunlight do not let cleaning agents come in contact with weatherstrip or finishes as they could cause damage how to clean screens carefully remove the screen and lay it on a flat clean area remove any dust by lightly spraying the screen with water from a hose or vacuuming with a soft brush extension instead of drying with a cloth let the screen air-dry completely before reinstalling for doors remove and replace screens from the exterior approved cleaners the following cleaners when used as directed can be used with ultrex®: glass

overspray of these solutions is safe never use a pressure washer directly on any part of a window or door wood surfaces how to maintain wood surfaces remove surface dirt and check the exterior of your wood windows and doors at least once a year to ensure that wood is not exposed to the elements by failing caulk or paint that has cracked peeled or bubbled remove superficial surface dirt by washing painted wood exteriors with water and a soft-bristled long-handled brush such as those used for washing cars a toothbrush works well to remove build-up from cracks and crevasses heavier accumulations can be removed with an approved cleaning solution other cleaning solutions consisting of alcohol/water mixtures are also effective wash from top to bottom to minimize streaking use clean water to rinse off detergent solutions or cleaners which can damage the finish if not removed grease or oily substances may require stronger cleaning compounds avoid solvents or abrasive cleaners don’t let strong detergents ammonia chemicals or other harsh cleaning substances get onto finished exterior surfaces which can be damaged nicks and scratches in a painted finish can be touched up with a matching high-quality latex primer and paint contact your local paint supply store for product recommendations and instructions if you have a brand new bare wood or primed window or door you must finish it immediately to prevent possible damage to the wood please view painting and staining for instructions how to paint wood surfaces of marvin windows and doors a new marvin window or door whether it is primed or bare wood must be painted immediately to prevent possible damage even if the window or door is already primed primers function to maximize adhesion between the wood and the paint but do not offer protective qualities immediately after installing clean and dry bare wood surfaces before applying paint or finish remove handling marks debris or moisture damage by sanding lightly with 220 or 320 grit sandpaper paint windows with sash or panels opened or removed altogether and do not close or reinstall until thoroughly dry before painting apply a strip of masking tape to the edge of the glass leaving a 1/16” 15mm space between the tape and the wood this will allow the paint to form a proper seal against the glass paints stains and varnishes contain solvents that should not come into momentary contact with plastics and vinyl used in weather stripping to avoid damage do not apply paint to weatherstrip vinyl plastic metal or any other non-wood parts which can be damaged by solvents in the finishes use a high-quality primer to ensure good paint adhesion apply one coat of primer and two coats of high-quality oil-base or latex paint following the paint manufacturers instructions do not apply paint to any surface which has sliding contact with another surface as this could impact the product’s ability to perform as designed do not use cleaners containing abrasives or solvents use an approved cleaning solution high humidity considerations: in addition to marvin’s general painting and staining instructions products installed in high humidity and high moisture environments should have a paint or finish applied to all accessible wood portions prior to installation use paint or finishes of a grade sufficient to protect the units from moisture damage providing water shedding properties while allowing water vapor to diffuse to the exterior units should be painted with operable sash removed marvin treats exposed millwork on windows and doors with a water-repellent wood preservative cuts or other disturbances to the millwork during installation or damage over the course of the product’s lifetime can expose untreated wood to the elements and potential deterioration protect untreated wood by applying a water-repellant wood preservative containing at least 05% ipbc following manufacturer’s instructions note: failure to retreat properly or adequately voids warranty windows and doors with wood exteriors should be inspected and repainted periodically repair any blistering peeling or cracking in the finish quickly to protect the underlying wood caulk any cracks prior to repainting using a high-quality caulking material or a paintable grade caulking compound how to stain wood interiors of marvin windows and doors marvin does not recommend the use of stain or clear coat finishes on exterior surfaces a new marvin window or door with bare wood must be stained immediately to prevent possible damage clean and dry wood
