mild steel 10 ga bottom side liners include 10 ga 7 ga or ¼” abrasive resistant steel or uhmw plastic howell conveyors use return rail with uhmw plastic on which the chain returns to head wider conveyors will also use tip rails to prevent the chain from twisting during conveying series i detector tail section series i detector tail sections are constructed with 10 ga material and use flange bearings detector tails utilize compression spring at the ends of the take ups to automatically take out slack from the chain during operation this eliminates the need to manually tension the chain this automatic style of take up also utilizes a shut off switch so that if the conveyor gets jammed or plugged it will immediately shut down the conveyor preventing extensive damage the same is true if the chain becomes too loose if there is a clearance issue a standard tail must be used detector tails are only available on conveyors with an incline less than 15 degrees series i tail section series i tail sections are constructed with 10 ga material they can have either flange or roller pillow block bearings tails will have 8” take-ups for tensioning if there is a clearance issue they can

discharge gate intermediate discharge gates are made of 10 ga material and can be manually operated with the use of a cable chain or hand wheel or they can be electrically operated knee bend section knee bend sections are designed to incline a drag conveyor after it runs horizontal this is to get the desired discharge height without inclining the entire conveyor they can incline 5-45 degrees depending on what is needed they are constructed from the same material as the trough bypass inlet bypass inlets can be a variety of different sizes they are available with grating for use as a dump pit or with a companion flange the purpose of the bypass inlet is to direct the product around the returning chain with the use of a hogback and enter the conveyor through the sides this allows the conveyor to be flood fed without plugging because the bypass inlet only allows what the conveyor can handle this is ideal for truck or rail receiving pits or for reclaiming storage bins standard inlet standard inlets are field installed where product is to enter the conveyor they include a hogback to divert the product over the chain and return rail combo inlet gate combo inlet gates are much like a standard inlet except they have a door that can be closed to shut-off product flow into the conveyor these can be manually operated with the use of a cable chain or hand wheel or they can be electrically operated ladder inlet gate ladder inlet gates allow controlled flow of product into a conveyor which allows the conveyor to be flood fed these can be manually operated with the use of a
