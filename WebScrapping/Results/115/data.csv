items q how deep can i install goldflex the installation procedures for goldflex are similar to goldline single-wall pipe and has similar burial depth recommendations a minimum cover of 24” is recommended for standard agricultural equipment loading and a maximum cover of 8’ for standard plow installation in suitable soil deeper burial depths can be achieved in certain soils or with crushed rock surrounding the pipe q how much research and development has been done on goldflex over one million feet of goldflex has been successfully installed throughout the united states and canada in the past 6 years these field tests in addition to many laboratory tests make goldflex the most extensively tested flexible dual wall pipe on the market q what types of perforations are available with goldflex goldflex is available non-perforated with narrow-slot perforations or socked with standard perforations perforation configurations for all diameters and types of prinsco pipe can be found in the perforation pattern technical note at prinscocom q what’s the best way to connect coils of goldflex the most common way of connecting goldflex is with an external snap coupler secured with heavy duty zip ties and a generous amount of tile tape the tape should only contact the coupler allowing the pipe to rotate within the coupler while uncoiling which helps reduce binding and stress on the pipe q do i need a custom boot to install goldflex most factory boots designed to install large diameter single wall pipe can be used to install goldflex of the same diameter a minimum 50-inch bend radius is recommended to minimize the forces on the pipe as it moves through the boot more specific boot dimensions are referenced in prinsco’s goldflex installation guide agriculture core products

agriculture > support > q & a q & a how will subsurface water management affect overall farming operationstoggle subsurface water management allow soils to shed excess moisture and warm up faster in the spring allowing for field operations to commence earlier in the season it will also help fields with intermittent wet spots dry more uniformly will subsurface water management stress crops in dry yearstoggle while the greatest benefits of subsurface water management are realized in wet years it also promotes deep root development which gives crops better access to soil moisture in dry years by using a control structure with subsurface water management systems water can also be held back throughout the growing season to keep moisture available to crops when it is needed most will adding subsurface water management to a field increase chances of flooding in local streamstoggle prinsco subsurface water management systems promote greater infiltration rates in the soil this allows for more water to be pulled down into the soil decreasing the amount of runoff water that is pulled into the soil is released from tile into waterways more slowly than it would be flowing over land therefore the chance for flooding actually decreases research has shown that adding subsurface water management increases the base flow by 5-10% but only after the chance for flooding has dissipated what tile spacing should i use for a fieldtoggle there are several factors that affect how you should space between tile lines including soil type tile depth drainage coefficient and tile diameter drainage coefficients determine the rate at which water will be removed from the soil and typically range from 1/8” – 1” per 24 hours depending on your soil type the drainage coefficient you use will determine what spacing you need to maximize the yield and profitability of your system when should i consider smaller pipe perforations or the use of pipe socktoggle first it is necessary to understand the properties of the soil at the depth your pipe will be installed a soil test should be performed to determine the soil type and particle size heavy soils such as clay or loam will typically require standard perforated pipe while sandy soils will likely require sock or narrow slot pipe when deciding between sock versus narrow slot pipe consider the 25% rule — if soils are less than 25% clay they probably need sock pipe how should dual wall pipe joints be assembledtoggle pipe equipped with integral bell and spigot joints such as prinsco’s ecoflo® 100 or goldflo wt® must be installed by inserting the spigot into the bell pushing the bell onto the spigot increases the likelihood of bedding material being forced into the joint disrupting the gasket and severely undermining joint performance pipe laying should always begin at the outlet with the spigots pointed downgrade when are fields too flat to drain how would i provide an adequate outlet for a subsurface water management systemtoggle in order for tile laterals to provide proper subsurface water management a minimum grade of 005 to 01% should be maintained where the topography does not allow for a gravity flow outlet pumped outlets can be used prinsco’s ag catch basins provide the right storage solution for pumped outlets what is the maximum burial depth for the pipetoggle achieving maximum burial depths is largely dependent on proper installation practices for burial depths of 8 feet or less prinsco recommends a shapedbottom trench for burial depths of more than 8 feet a standard trench installation should be used as shown in our ag installation guide proper installation positively contributes to the load carrying capacity of the pipe resulting in greater burial depths contact your local prinsco representative to discuss maximum burial depths for your installation can water be sent from one watershed into a different watershedtoggle no most state drainage laws are clear that water may not be transferred from one watershed to another adding water to a watershed can cause increased erosion for example increasing water flow in a in a stream can cause an unstable stream bank

stormwater > support > q & a q & a what is the minimum cover for the hdpe pipetoggle refer to the minimum and maximum burial depth per aashto tech note minimum cover heights are dependent on the backfill material used and the expected live loads for aashto hl-93 h-25 or hs-25 loading pipe with diameters of 4”-48” shall have a minimum of one foot of cover while 60” diameter pipe must have at least 18 inches of cover cover heights are measured from the top of the pipe to the bottom of flexible pavement or to the top of rigid pavement minimum covers assume class iii backfill material compacted to 90% standard proctor density around the pipe and a minimum of 6-inches over the pipe crown for construction loading additional backfill may be necessary for heavy construction loads between 30-60 tons a minimum of 3 feet of cover shall be used what is the maximum burial depth for hdpe pipetoggle refer to the minimum and maximum burial depth per aashto tech note the maximum cover is significantly influenced by the type of backfill material used and level of compaction special care is necessary for deep burial depth installations for burial depths that exceed recommendations contact your prinsco representative to review the site specific information what is the load rating for hdpe pipetoggle hdpe is a flexible pipe that relies heavily on the strenh of the embedment soil for its strenh with the requirements for minimum cover met hdpe pipe is rated for aashto h-25 loading refer to the standard trench installation detail for backfill and compaction requirements note that the minimum burial depth requirements for parallel pipe installations may require additional cover for heavier loading scenarios contact your prinsco representative are recycled materials used in hdpe pipetoggle prinsco manufactures pipe to meet the specifications of aashto m294 & m252 which require virgin compounds be used for the manufacturing process however prinsco has incorporated recycled resins into their manufacturing process for over 10 years and have mastered the blending process after years of blending technology and research prinsco has manufactured a product called ecoflo® 100 that utilizes 40% recycled material and has a 100 year service life that kind of performance is unprecedented in a recycled product ecoflo® 100 meets or exceeds the requirements of aashto m294 with the exception of the recycled content does hdpe pipe have uv resistancetoggle hdpe pipe meeting the requirements of aashto m294 or m252 is manufactured with carbon black colorant which protects the pipe from uv degradation carbon black has been proven to protect pipe for years without affecting the performance once the pipe is installed the pipe is no longer exposed to uv degradation the exposed ends of the pipe will not be subjected to the stresses of buried pipe and are not a consideration for the effects of uv degradation how do i connect hdpe to dissimilar materialstoggle the most common method for joining dissimilar products is to butt the ends together wrap the connection in a non-woven geotextile wrap and pour a concrete collar around the connection prinsco also offers a number of fittings and accessories including clay adapters fabricated pipe adapters and marmac couplers for joining dissimilar products contact your local prinsco representative for the best option for your application what is the maximum amount of misalignment for bell and spigot connections using goldflo wt® or ecoflo® 100toggle during pipe joint assembly it is critical to ensure the pipe lenhs are aligned both vertically and horizontally improper alignment will result in difficult or improper joint assembly and may cause the pipe joint to leak if the misalignment is necessary for grade or curvilinear alignment a maximum of 1 degree of misalignment is recommended prinsco offers a wide array of standard and custom fittings for curved alignments contact your local prinsco representative for more information what is the difference between underground retention and detention systemstoggle underground retention & detention systems are both designed to collect stormwater and release it at controlled rate to eliminate downstream flooding the main difference is between the two is the period of time the water is retained within the system a detention system is designed to slow and temporarily hold stormwater runoff in a contained area until it can be released at a controlled rate the outlet of the system is typically at the lowest point in the system allowing the system to slowly but completely drain a retention system is also designed to slow and temporarily hold stormwater runoff however the containment pipe is perforated allowing for the water to infiltrate into the soil and recharge the groundwater table the outlet of the retention system is typically placed near the highest point of the system this allows the stormwater to flow downstream in the event of excessive or strong storms without backing up the system upstream stormwater core products fittings & accessories applications projects support resource library q & a engineering
