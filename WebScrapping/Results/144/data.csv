can be done in several fashions step bevels are recommended for all pipe sizes step bevels are typically limited to 3:1 2:1 or steeper slopes on long span and larger structural plate pipe depending on their rise full and partial bevels are typically applicable only to smaller pipe the ncspa design manual is your guide to the best option on a bevel cut for your project we also have standard detail drawings on optional bevel cuts for your reference headwalls prefabricated steel headwalls are designed to accommodate pipe diameters from 12” to 144” skewed end pipes and pipe arches wingwalls if required can be designed and provided as well headwalls are pre-attached to the end of the pipe and pre-assembled at the factory to assure proper fit and finish standard flared end sections standard flared end sections are not only long-lasting and easy to maintain they are up to standards and easy to install matching the fill slopes the end section “finishes” the appearance of the culvert and keeps grass weeds and debris from the culvert opening it also increases flow characteristics preventing scouring and undercutting available in sizes 6” to 96” round as well as arched sizes 17”x13” to

levels all the fittings and marks the center lines on each tank these details save installers several hours of work normally spent on the pre-installation testing and cleaning of non-metallic tanks truenorth steel delivers elutron® tanks with vacuums applied and center lines marked to simplify and expedite installation technology elutron’s unique and time-proven double-walled fiberglass jacketed tank technology provides reliable performance safety and ease of installation the inner steel tank is designed to contain gasoline jet a avgas diesel def and methanol/ethanol in varying concentrations the outer fiberglass “frp” jacket and inner steel tank are separated by an interstitial space allowing monitoring of tank integrity the outer frp jacket acts as a corrosion barrier against aggressive and corrosion underground conditions ensuring outstanding long-term tank performance the ul listed elutron® double walled fiberglass jacketed tank system meets the epa 40 cfr subpart b 28020 standards for new underground storage tanks tank built and tested in accordance with ul58 steel underground tanks for flammable and combustible liquids and ul1746 external corrosion protection systems for steel

has long been the preferred material for architectural framework but when it’s recognized for its innate beauty as well as its structural integrity the results can be awe-inspiring revered architects have challenged the idea of using steel merely to construct a building’s skeleton and have instead created innovative and surprisingly fluid structures that allow the material to take center stage what’s more many modern architects are experimenting with the aesthetics of steel from cultivating rust for an aged patina to polishing for a high shine to bronzing for a warmer finish our team has experience working on all facets of structural steel manufacturing and fabrication from pre-construction to installation we have worked on hundreds of high profile projects in commercial industrial and civil applications to make your architectural vision a reality out of structural steel at truenorth steel we work closely with the construction team combining their vision with our experience to ensure building projects are designed fabricated and built to specifications on time and as efficiently as possible we visualize each project’s use of structural steel from both an architectural and

truerail is that it provides architects with complete control when creating complicated steel rail designs truerail is designed not to replace current steel rail solutions but to offer an additional layer of customization with that in mind truerail can be used with most existing and new steel rail systems for architects looking for design flexibility truerail offers the ability to enhance the aesthetic appeal of 8-line and picket rail systems already in place j customizable design truerail features a customizable design making it the perfect solution for a wide range of projects designs can be chosen using our library of designs or architects can work directly with truenorth steel to create a totally custom design rail panels can also be fabricated to include accent colors and logos for a cohesive branded look  cost effective truerail is a more economical solution to current rail systems users now have the ability to create a customized design for the same price or less than other steel rail systems on the market in addition truerail can be used with existing steel rail systems rather than replacing the whole system not only is this more cost-effective but it also saves time reduce production times our truerail system functions with most existing steel rail systems and the installation are as easy as swapping out spindles with the custom rail panels truerail panels can be installed in as little as a third of the time it takes to install 8-line and picket rail systems  increased safety at truenorth steel we believe safety is paramount and our products reflect

provides protection for up to 24 months turf reinforcement mats a permanent turf reinforcement mats allow vegetation to be used for scour prevention where flow conditions exceed the shear limits of natural vegetation the permanent turf mat reinforces the root-and-stem systems of the vegetation and protects against the high shear stress water flow we will advise availability of the right trm for your situation flexamat® tied concrete block mat is a generic term for flexamat flexamat consists of concrete shapes locked together with a high strenh polypropylene geogrid there are openings around each concrete block that give flexamat the flexibility and enable it to be packaged in rolls the openings also allow vegetation to grow through the mat eventually vegetation will completely cover flexamat it can be manufactured with various backings such as non-woven fabric to stop vegetation growth or a trm turf re-enforcement mat depending on the soil conditions and other factors there’s a wide range of applications where flexamat is utilized but it is most commonly used for erosion control flexamat is used to control erosion in channels outlet protection on slopes for shoreline protection and many other applications flexamat offers permanent hard armor protection with a natural vegetated appearance flexamat may be mowed over with commercial mowing equipment or left to grow wild besides grass there are many other types of native plant species that can be planted to grow within the mat for example willow saplings were planted through flexamat for a streambank

commitment quality our process step 1: conceptualize our team has the experience to help you make your steel pedestrian bridge unique and your own whether that means custom truss designs railings roofs decks or colors truenorth steel can make it happen step 2: design our experienced bridge design engineers use state-of-the-art design software and are registered in all 50 states ensuring that our bridge designs meet all published applicable standards our engineer’s first priorities are to provide safety and longevity in every bridge design but closely behind comes their ability to provide efficient designs truenorth steel bridge engineers have extensive knowledge of state and local design requirements which translates into expedited design reviews and approvals step 3: fabricate 75 years of steel fabrication has taught us how to do it right weld quality fit finish and all of the details are as important to us as they are to you our facilities are all certified and audited by the american iron and steel institute and our internal quality systems ensure that when our bridges go out the door they reflect the pride we take in our work step 4: installation truenorth steel pedestrian bridges are designed for simple and efficient installation we understand that every project is unique so we work closely with all parties by conducting preconstruction meetings ensuring a safe and easy bridge installation our bridges arrive on site in single sections capable of being lifted by crane from a truck and set directly in place on abutments bridge sections can also be spliced
