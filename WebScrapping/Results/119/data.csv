gift cards home / news previous / next our shark tank experience march 02 2016 4 min read 3 comments our shark tank experience cold audition it was some time before christmas of 2014 when erik hopperstad prx performance president called to tell me that shark tank auditions were going to be in florida the day before we were supposed to be there for a conference he asked me what i thought and i was already on the airline’s website to change our tickets we arrived for auditions in january of 2015 not knowing what to expect we were one of over 700 other hopefuls that showed up that day the producers told us it was going to be an easy in-and-out and not to expect any kind of follow-up we’d have one minute to deliver our pitch and make it stick well we apparently made an impression because we heard back within a couple of weeks we were asked to make an audition tape we had a blast filming erik hopperstad president and brian brasch ceo filming their audition tape for our audition we wanted to tell the story of where and why our products were created a popular maker of crossfit equipment was urging people to turn their garage into a gym well that concept doesnt work for us in north dakota so we came up with a line of products that fold up out of the way when not in usethereby transforming your garage into a gym and still allowing you to park your car in there ownthewall that worked we had a film date oh wow we had a film date no idea what to expect as a small startup the amount of preparation you have to do to get ready to go in the ‘tank’ is crazy intense it’s like pitching to a venture capitalist…except instead of culling your pitch to one vc you have to prepare to go in front of five and each of the five has different things they look for when sizing up a possible investment so we tried to prepare ourselves for any one of the curveballs they could throw at us the next few months were spent figuring out our pitch working with the abc team and then finally practicing practicing practicing our intro to the sharks we can’t believe we were able to answer their questions with any semblance of coherency just shows what the brain can do under such intense pressure that pesky non-disclosure agreement erik hopperstad president and brian brasch ceo filming shark tank so we filmed in june of 2015 and were under an extremely stringent non-disclosure agreement we were allowed to share with our spouses and that was it here you’ve got the best news of your life and you can’t tell anyone we couldn’t even share that we’d filmed much less that we’d gotten a deal fast-forward to february – what a ride we got official word in january that our episode was going to air but didn’t get an actual air date we heard in early february that we’d be airing on the 26th and could start actually telling people about two weeks prior to our episode airing that’s when things really started to kick in to high speed we had been talking about doing a website re-design and decided we really wanted to put our best foot forward for the influx of traffic we’d see and then inventory how do you prepare for something on this scale we felt like we were in pretty good shape until abc called us about noon on thursday february 18th to let us know our episode had gotten bumped up and would be airing on sunday february 21st instead of the original february 26th date so yeah we were still days away from putting the new website live we hadnt contacted any press yet we had to redo all our social posts with new dates and we had planned to have inventory come in the week of the show not prior i think we all had our mini-meltdowns when we heard the news and then just got to work we quickly re-scheduled the viewing party we had just gotten lined up put the website redesign on steroids contacted our vendors to get our materials here as fast as possible and basically just tried to keep our heads above water for the next week or so the viewing party we invited friends and family out to a local brewing company thanks drekker to join us to watch the live airing of our episode what an amazing and fun night it was wonderful to be surrounded by so much love and support for the big reveal everyone cheered when we got our deal and cheered even louder when we put up this photo that kevin olearys our shark investor publicist sent us a buffed up kevin oleary the next chapter after the episode aired kevin filmed a special video to congratulate us on our deal and with the message go make me some money so our plans going forward are to do just that weve got several products in the research and development pipeline and are excited to have additional resources to devote to that ﻿spoiler: watch for our kickstarter coming soon for a product we know is going to be our most popular yet 3 responses joshua smith february 04 2019 would like to use yall in my gym when open and maybe get y’all to sell mma stuff and gear also paula shaw april 21 2017

durable rugged steel cage that’s designed to serve as a base for your weighted workout equipment most also require adding optional add-ons if you want to use them for non-barbell exercises there’s a lot to consider when shopping for the best home power rack for you:style and functionality: power racks can serve a wide variety of functions including as a pull-up bar a bench press a squat rack—the list goes on the best models are multifunctional to allow for dozens of full-body workouts it all comes down to your workout style consider your regular workouts and shop for power racks that offer everything you need if youre short on space you can skip the pull-up bar for a more full-featured option you might want a beefy full power cage with multiple add-ons and attachments that expand your workout optionsweight capacity: every power rack has a corresponding weight limit with most models ranging between 300 and 1500 pounds always aim for a rack that has at least a 500-pound weight capacity no you may never lift 500 pounds on any single movement but youll thank yourself for having that margin for error if you ever miss on a squat and lose control of the bar customizability: the best power racks are customizable to fit your personal routine from if youre tight on space you might opt for a foldable racks because theyre great from foot print size to height to additional accessory options every cage will offers a slightly different level of customization if you have larger home gym and are interesting in building things out consider a power rack a strong starting point and shop closely for the features that matter to you the most attachments: this is another place where if you can afford it it’s worth splurging on a rack with more adjustability to adapt to your workout needs now and in the future in the long run purchasing a rack that can grow with you will allow you to get more out of your home gym investment at the very least make sure the rack you choose comes with the basics like safety bars or straps says david otey cscs fitness writer and nyc-based strenh coach i would also recommend a landmine to diversify movements and band pegs to add variety to movementsdurability: the type of construction is heavily tied in with a rack’s total weight capacity almost every model on the market today is made of steel alloy steel or powder-coated steel the true measure of strenh is the gauge of steel used the higher gauge the stronger the cage beginners may not need to worry about this when starting out but better-quality steel will always be safer more durable better equipped to handle heavy weights and more long-lastingpower rack vs half rack: whats the differenceas you mightve noticed weve included a few half racks in the list above theres a distinct difference between power racks and half racks but weve found that most people either dont have the space for a full rack or dont really need more than a half rack at their fitness level its up to you to decide which would better suit your needs a power rack is a 4-6 post rack you would do most of your lifts in explains otey think of a power rack as a cage-like structure it also features at least two horizontal bars catches on each side which are adjustable in height and function as mechanical spotters most power racks leave room to be outfitted with a variety of accessories like pulleys a lat pull down bar etc a half rack on the other hand is a shallow 4 post where lifts are executed on the outside of the rack otey told mens health half racks are comprised of 2 vertical posts and can also feature horizontal safety bars that being said the stability and maximum weight capacity associated with a half-rack is typically inferior compared to a power rack theres also less room for add-on accessories if you are limited on space or are a beginner a half-rack could be a solid choice for you if you only have room for a half rack and are concerned about stability look for one that gives the user an option to anchor or bolt the equipment to the groundadvertisement - continue reading belowwhy buy a power rackit all comes down to one thing according to otey: safety yeah you can lift a barbell at home without a power rack but when it comes to lifting safely without a human spotter we highly recommend using it the key to working out at home is ensuring you are safe and there is no better way than having a power rack he saysits not a substitute for a human spot on your heaviest lifts thats how injuries happen but it does offer you security and assurance you might not have otherwise the right power rack can also set you up to do pull-ups hanging abs movements and much more especially in this era when racks are expandable and have added attachments that can push you fartheras our fitness director ebenezer samuel puts it this is the centerpiece of your home gym and it insures youre pushing yourself with leg training with a home power rack you can have access to more weight and versatility compared to dumbbells and other home-gym accessories combined allowing you to progress your lifts without scrambling to find heavier dumbbells or compound movements many power racks offer a selection of accessories that allow you to perform additional strenh training exercises straight from the rack these add-ons will cost you in addition to the cage itself but if you want to get the most out of your home gym investment youll use a good power rack in a variety of wayshow to use a power racka power rack can be used for virtually any barbell exercise you can think of think squatting deadlift bench pressing all of the major lifts says otey a power rack can be a one-stop gym where everything can be accomplished its important to note that benches are often sold separately and may not be included with a purchase of a cage depending on a racks specifications and add-ons you may be able to use it to perform a variety of non-barbell strenh exercises such as lat pull downs pull ups and pulley exercises although many of these accessories are compatible with various racks it’s important to use them only with the equipment they were designed for additionally be
