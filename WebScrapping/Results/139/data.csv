1,about us – tharaldson ethanol skip to content who we are and what we do tharaldson ethanol is located just west of casselton nd an area known for its rich farming tradition tharaldson ethanol provides a much-needed local market for area corn growers requiring about 60 million bushels of corn annually which will in turn produce 170 million gallons of ethanol and about 450000 tons of dried distiller’s grain each year our state-of-the-art facility has the latest most innovative and energy efficient technology in the marketplace here are some of the highlights:low natural gas consumption per gallon of ethanol produced due to reusing energy throughout the facilitylow water consumption per gallon of ethanol producedno use of area groundwater resources as the facility uses the city of fargo’s wastewater to operateexcellent state highway and interstate access combined with direct access to both the bnsf railway and the red river valley & western railroad providing the plant with efficient means of transporting both inbound and outbound commoditiesextensive grain storage infrastructure including a grain dryer to accommodate wet corn 3549 153rd avenue se casselton nd 580127013474000 by tharaldson ethanol all rights reserved
2,distillers grain – tharaldson ethanol skip to content distillers grain distiller’s grain is an important co-product of dry mill ethanol production dry mill ethanol production process uses only the starch portion of the corn which is about 70% of the kernel all the remaining nutrients – protein fat minerals and vitamins – are concentrated into distillers grain a valuable feed for livestock a bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds and will produce at least 28 gallons of ethanol and 17 pounds of distiller’s graindistillers grain can be fed to livestock wet or dry dried distillers grain ddg is the most common variety drying the distillers grain increases its shelf life and improves its ability to be transported over longer distances if a consistent nearby market can be secured ethanol producers can supply the feed as wet distillers grain wdg the wet form is not as easily transportable but the cost of drying the product is removeddried distillers grain with soluble ddgs is the form available to the feed industry the liquid that is separated from the mash during the distilling process is partially dehydrated into a syrup then added back onto the dried distillers grain to create ddgsddgs is a high quality feedstuff ration for dairy cattle beef cattle swine poultry and aquaculture the feed is an economical partial replacement for corn soybean meal and dicalcium phosphate in livestock and poultry feeds historically over 85% of ddgs has been fed to dairy and beef cattle and ddgs continues to be an excellent economical feed ingredient for use in ruminant diets source: american coalition for ethanolfor availability & prices please contact:keith finney at 701-429-7089 ordoug lingen at 701-347-3321 3549 153rd avenue se casselton nd 580127013474000 by tharaldson ethanol all rights reserved
3,ethanol – tharaldson ethanol skip to content ethanol renewable fuels association 2005-2008the production of ethanol or ethyl alcohol from starch or sugar-based feedstocks is among man’s earliest ventures into value-added processing while the basic steps remain the same the process has been considerably refined in recent years leading to a very efficient process there are two production processes: wet milling and dry milling the main difference between the two is in the initial treatment of the grain importantly companies today are involved in technological innovations such as cold starch fermentation corn fractionation and corn oil extraction companies are also utilizing biomass gasification and methane digesters to reduce natural gas consumption additional work is being done to reduce energy consumption and production costs increase efficiency and reduce emissions using the best available control technologiesin dry milling the entire corn kernel or other starchy grain is first ground into flour which is referred to in the industry as “meal” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain the meal is slurried with water to form a “mash” enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to dextrose a simple sugar ammonia is added for ph control and as a nutrient to the yeast the mash is processed in a high-temperature cooker to reduce bacteria levels ahead of fermentation the mash is cooled and transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide co2 begins the fermentation process generally takes about 40 to 50 hours during this part of the process the mash is agitated and kept cool to facilitate the activity of the yeast after fermentation the resulting “beer” is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” the ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using conventional distillation and then is dehydrated to approximately 200 proof in a molecular sieve system the anhydrous ethanol is then blended with about 5% denaturant such as natural gasoline to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax it is then ready for shipment to gasoline terminals or retailers the stillage is sent through a centrifuge that separates the coarse grain from the solubles the solubles are then concentrated to about 30% solids by evaporation resulting in condensed distillers solubles cds or “syrup” the coarse grain and the syrup are then dried together to produce dried distillers grains with solubles ddgs a high quality nutritious livestock feed the co2 released during fermentation can be captured and sold for use in carbonating soft drinks and beverages and the manufacture of dry ice 3549 153rd avenue se casselton nd 580127013474000 by tharaldson ethanol all rights reserved
