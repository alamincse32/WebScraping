1,smart batteries - packet digital skip to main content smart batteries for uas and beyond the smarter your battery is the better your technology performs in many ways lithium-ion batteries are the most important component of any modern technology by transforming standard batteries into smart batteries packet digital changes a required component into an invaluable asset contact us to learn more what is a “smart battery” a true smart battery pairs cells with electronics that provide real-time monitoring and reporting of critical performance data this data provides important information to your flight computer allowing it to make decisions in flight ensuring safe and reliable operation and early notice of developing problems it also communicates with the charging system to ensure safe charging and prevent catastrophic failures smart batteries can also ensure safe storage and shipping by de-energizing the outputs when not attached to a uas or charger from a hardware aspect it’s the bms battery management system a circuit board that is paired with the cells that makes a smart battery different than a traditional or “dumb” battery maximize flight time and profits by using energy more efficiently an unmanned aircraft is able to fly longer on a charge making every trip more productive collect important data think of a smart battery as a black box for the uas recording and reporting how the battery is treated and how it performs under ever-changing conditions improve operational safety regulatory focus will become even more intense as uas take to the skies above population centers making battery status more important reduce aircraft weight by maximizing your available battery footprint you eliminate the need for backup batteries or larger batteries increase battery life by regulating charging smart batteries from packet digital are able to last longer and age more gracefully packet digital’s custom battery development experience anduril the maker of the ghost vtol group 2 suas contracted packet digital to manufacture batteries packet digital manufacturing capabilities were essential to tackle this highly challenging build additionally packet was able to quickly resolve critical supply chain issues through collaboration and experience with top component providers lockheed martin contracted with packet digital to design and manufacture batteries for their indago 4 uas platform “we have been cycling packet digital’s battery for 6 months it is now at 1000 cycles that’s 10x better than anything we have ever seen and it only shows 11% degradation” – lockheed martin chief engineer smart batteries from packet digital high cycle life lipo batteries with battery management system accurate state-of-charge monitoring and reportingstores critical lifetime information such as:total usagefaultsoverall pack health and estimationusb connectivity for computer/phone/tablet interfacetechnology is adaptable to other configurationsrecord min/max voltage and current questions we have answers what questions should you ask your battery designer or supplier what does c-rate mean what discharge rate do i need for my pack c-rate refers to how much current it takes to discharge the pack in 1 hour it’s essentially the inverse of the pack capacity a 10000 milli-amp-hour mah battery can supply 10 amps of current for 1 hour theoretically if that pack is rated for 1c discharge rate then it can do that if it’s rated for 2c that means that it can actually source 20a for a half hour if it’s rated for 4c it can source 40a if it’s rated for 100c it can source 1000a this is of course a simplification there are different rates for very short duration pulses somewhat short duration pulses 10s and continuous >10s the shorter duration ratings are often the ones marketed but the continuous rating is what is usually important note that continuous is only defined as 10s duration when you get into that time scale you have to deal with chemical diffusions which are a slow process there are two ways to look at your c rating and it’s useful to look at both one is your peak current if you need 100 amps of current for more than 10s continuous then you need a pack that’s rated for 100 / capacity c-rate but it can be difficult to estimate the continuous current so if you know your minimum flight time you can use that to directly calculate the c rate if you fly for 15 minutes minimum with your biggest payload and highest wind conditions then you need a 4c pack realistically you’ll want to add some margin since you might have some short bursts of higher current it’s easy to get into a situation where your power system is theoretically capable of draining your pack in 2 minutes but in reality you have 15 minutes of flight time so you do need to look at things both ways and use your judgment to select an appropriate pack if you don’t have the capability to simulate or measure actual requirements what does 6s2p mean s is series and p is parallel series raises voltage and parallel raises amp-hour capacity either configuration raises total energy capacity by the same amount more parallel cells increases the amp-hours and current rating of the pack and more series cells increases the voltage of the pack what power density do i need there is a tradeoff between power and energy density that can be compensated for with added cost high power cells and high energy cells can be made relatively cheaply but high power cells that are also high energy require complex expensive design it’s important to look at the continuous c-rating of the cells and consider that higher voltages might make the whole system more efficient when looking at the c-rating make sure to consider that there is a pulse rating and a continuous rating generally anything over 10 seconds is considered continuous so if your peak current happens at takeoff or landing you need to spec your pack based on that does the battery connect to an autopilot for real time telemetry data a smart battery that can’t communicate with the vehicle has little value what is the real-world cycle life of the pack not just the cells cycle life of a pack is worse than that of the cells that it comprises the weakest link determines the fate of the pack so looking at average cycle life of cells isn’t directly useful in estimating your pack cycle life pack cycle life may be 50% or even worse due to variation in cells and thermal and electrical imbalance in the pack design if you have a target pack cycle life in mind make sure to investigate what that means when compared to the cell cycle life because they are not the same thing what voltage should i use you can increase voltage by adding cells in series the tradeoff is that for the same weight of battery you’ll have lower amp-hour capacity but higher voltage and the same amount of energy the benefit is that at higher voltages you can draw less current for the same amount of power this is good because efficiency is inversely proportional to current so we increase system efficiency by raising voltage you can use smaller lighter wires and more compact motors with higher voltage higher voltage does come with costs high voltage electronics tend to cost more so ultimately voltage tends to scale with vehicle size however it’s usually useful to design toward higher voltages if your goals are higher efficiency and longer endurance what energy density do i need energy density is simply the energy capacity voltage amp-hour capacity of the pack divided by the weight the energy of the pack is proportional to your endurance and the weight of the pack is also inversely proportional the battery is usually one of the largest weights and so is targeted for optimization energy density at the pack level includes the weight of the enclosure wires connectors bms and other packaging materials and results in a somewhat lower energy density than you would see at the cell level cost tends to increase exponentially with increased energy density so while high energy density packs are extremely valuable for long endurance aircraft it’s one part of an overall weight reduction strategy that should be discussed and considered carefully is cooling necessary generally speaking yes unless you’re discharging so quickly that cooling won’t come into play maybe 2-5 minutes flight time cooling can make an important difference in system performance high energy cells tend to produce more heat and efficiently removing that heat means that you can keep those cells cool and last for many flights high power high energy and sealed systems with no cooling are the worst situation for batteries and typically result in the shortest cycle lives country of origin country of manufacture smart batteries process data and communicate with the aircraft and therefore are or will be restricted by country of origin for government use operating environment: water resistanceshock & vibetemperature extremes both for charging and dischargingrequired cooling

One of the key milestones in achieving this goal was the installation of a surface mount technology (SMT) line — the first of its kind for Packet Digital. The SMT line allows Packet Digital to manufacture its own printed circuit boards (PCBs) in-house. Up to 130 unique components can be populated on each side of the board, primarily using a lead-free process. With board assembly done in-house, Packet Digital will now be able to optimize designs for an efficient manufacturing process. Control of production timelines as well as flexibility in PCB sourcing allows Packet Digital to offer more reliable timelines and better pricing to its customers. Assembled PCBs will be incorporated into existing Packet Digital products such as battery packs and chargers, in addition to direct sales to strategic partners. To accomplish these goals, a variety of machines were installed to complete the SMT line, including: a solder paste printer, solder paste inspection, pick and place machine, optical inspection, and multi-zone reflow oven. Aside from the machinery itself, humidity controls and electrostatic discharge (ESD) flooring were installed to ensure quality production. What is an SMT line? SMT is the process of mounting electronic components directly onto the surface of a PCB. The process is automated, allowing boards to be produced quicker and more accurately than manual population of components. The process begins with the solder paste printer and inspection machines that place solder on the board and verify that it was applied correctly. When the solder application process is complete, electronic components are then placed on circuit boards by the high-speed pick and place machine. It takes individual components from reels or trays and places them precisely where they belong on the PCB on top of the solder paste. The optical inspection machine then allows our assemblers to detect any issues and ensure the quality of each individual component on the board. Once the board has been cleared for production, it moves to the multi-zone reflow oven where the solder is melted to make electro-mechanical connections with the components. After this the board is now complete and moves on to QA testing, programming, coating and final assembly into products. ← Packet Digital Creating State of the Art Battery Manufacturing Facility in Fargo, ND ""*"" indicates required fields Subscribe to email:* CAPTCHACommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
