collars custom dog collars for safety and style customizing a dog collar with all the options we offer at dogids is fun its also the most important thing you can do for your dog when it comes to safety keeping your dog known and safely home is critical and our top priority here at dogids is dog identification let your creativity flow while exploring our dog collar styles and build your furry friends new favorite forever collar a personalized dog collar with personal contact info is hands down the most effective and practical solution to ensure your dog is easily identified and safely returned home if ever lost a collar with a name and phone number boldly displayed right on the collar improves the odds of someone finding your contact information easily and returning your dog home as swiftly as possible importance of dog collars personalized for identification its not always easy identifying a lost dog reading a dogs id tag when theyre lost isnt always an easy task often a stray dog is very anxious about being lost and very excited to see a new human at the same time this can make finding a family phone number challenging some people are intimidated by a strange dog and would rather not risk getting bit or slobbered on while trying to find contact information on a pet tag under the dogs jowls in order to call his or her family a personalized dog collar with your name and phone number engraved on a name plate or embroidered on the collar strap is much easier to notice and read while standing near an anxious lost dog personalized collars for dogs make identification easier if your dog is wearing a personalized dog collar its much easier for a finder to read your contact information and reach out to you most of the time without the need to even physically touch your dog our scrufftag collar improves the dog identification process even more by ensuring the personalized name plate always sits right on the back of your dogs neck or scruff making it even easier for someone who finds your lost pup to read your contact information and call you asap the scrufftag is also built into the structure of the collar so its impossible for it to ever fall off hanging dog tags are also a great method to identify dogs and have been used for decades successfully pet tags can also be easily moved or replaced and are super fun for accessorizing but tags can become hard to read sometimes and tags can fall off or get caught on obstacles now and then this isnt a risk with a collar that has an engraved name plate engraved buckle or embroidered collar strap personalized collars are a step-up when considering practicality and safety a dog collar with id cant be substituted microchipping is an excellent layer of protection but not a guarantee to get your dog home if they happen to wander microchips must be scanned with proprietary scanning devices usually only found at veterinary clinics or animal shelters so even if your canine companion is microchipped please make sure he or she is also always wearing a dog id tag or a collar with your name and contact information as visible as possible for someone trying to help them get home there are many dog tracking devices on the market too they work great for monitoring a dogs whereabouts and activities and can also be very effective tools to help a dog get home however batteries go dead the devices can be bulky for your dog and most are dependent on wi-fi or cell phone service which is not always dependable also keep in mind not everyone is tech-savvy especially when out in the woods or some other remote location away from their normal technology tools physical identification still must also be on a dog even if your dog wears an electronic tracking device create a unique engraved dog collar design a unique personalized pet collar we make many styles of great looking personalized custom dog collars that are tough as nails and super comfortable for a dog to wear we have so many options to choose from and just know youll enjoy designing yours just the way you want with so many collars for dogs on the market it can be difficult to choose the best one that truly complements your pet’s color size breed and personality at dogids we know that every dog is unique so we strive to offer the most customization options possible so you can align your custom collar design with your best friend perfectly from giant breeds to minis and all dog shapes sizes and activities between we’re here to help you choose the perfect personalized collar for your pup what information should be put on engraved dog collars well this is a very common question we get and a very important one at that personalized collars are pawesome but choosing what to have engraved or embroidered on a collar can be a difficult choice since you have a limited amount of space to work with for personalization on a collar strap buckle or name plate we recommend phone numbers for sure one is great but multiple phone numbers is always better name address city state etc are nice to include but phone numbers are definitely most important you want the person that finds your dog to be able to contact you asap and phone numbers are still the most effective means to get in touch with a pet parent a last name may be helpful too at times if you live in a community where everyone knows everyone sometimes a familiar family name helps to get the right people in the dog-return process should i put my name or my dogs name on the collar oh boy now were opening a can of worms that can cause heated debate we wont go there but we will tell you the arguments of both sides and let you choose first view: if you put the dogs name on an id tag or collar people will be able to gain the dogs trust and more easily steal them second view: if you put the dogs name on an id tag or collar the dog will feel less stressed if they hear the finder using their name we all like familiar right so do dogs its personal preference our default answer to people is to put your familys last name and as many phone numbers as you can on the id tag or collar about dogids collars our most popular styles waterproof: to suit the dog who

leather horse harnesses saddles and other custom leather horse products for companies and individuals all over the world it just so happened that steve also loved dogs and the art of making dog collars leashes and dog training accessories finally someone that knew how to make a leather dog collar that met his expectations needless to say clint and steve hit it off as friends very quickly old world collar making practices carried on clint decided to work alongside steve in his shop for a while and learn some things about the craft that steve mastered but was very difficult to find anywhere in the modern world he learned many tricks of the trade along the way no no crazy high-tech equipment but just plain common sense and passion driven skills needed to make custom dog collars and leashes that look great function well last forever and convince you when you have one in-hand that its a quality substantial product the practices clint learned are still integrated into our processes

must-have for dogs who love romping in lakes pools rivers or the ocean the waterproof and odor resistant strap we use is made by biothane and was originally developed for horse team harnesses so its extremely heavy-duty youll have to look pretty close to tell it apart from leather too because of its unique texture though its tough and waterproof youll be amazed how soft and grippy it feels in-hand nylon: nylon is a very popular leash material so you can find them everywhere not a leash like ours though weve spent many years finding a heavy-duty thick nylon webbing that is silky smooth and feels so nice in your hands prefer a lightweight lead this is a good choice for you rope: many people love to use a rope lead as the round shape feels so naturally comfortable in your hands youll love ours as theyre made with a very soft polypro rope which has a super soft feel they also easily roll up and stow away in the smallest spaces without getting bent out of shape leather: if you try a leather lead from dogids were quite confident it will eventually be your favorite to walk your canine companion with all of our leather leads are top grade leather mainly english bridle leather once they break in theyre so supple they feel so good in-hand and look so classy add a personalized name plate and wow they really look sharp reflective: reflective dog leashes can make a huge difference when walking your dog in low-light conditions the large surface area of reflectivity helps make you and your dog much more visible for safety specialty: if youre looking for a leash with special functionality check out our specialty leads collection from steady tabs to check cords weve got all the bases covered especially if youre into dog training what lenh dog leash do i need this mainly depends on your height the height of your dog and how much extra lenh you want to work with it also depends on the most common situations you find you and your pooch in when out and about if youre frequently walking in congested environments or with lots of traffic a traffic lead with a shorter handle may be a good option since this lead requires a dog to be right beside you in heel position otherwise a 4 or 6 foot lenh is most popular and can accommodate most leisure walk situations if youd like a lead that has multiple functions to train with and go for dog walks you may want to try either our leather or waterproof jaeger lead which is the best dog leash for walks this question is very subjective and mainly depends on what your needs are however most seasoned dog trainers recommend a 6 foot leash especially to train with so you always have some extra lenh to work with when needed if you then have a lot of slack in the lead you can just grab the excess with your other hand or roll it up around your lead hand when not needed that way if you want to let your pup sniff the latest marks on trees or say hi to his familiar neighborhood friends you dont have to try to cover the ground that he can specialty dog leads to get the job done do you walk multiple dogs at the same time snag yourself one of our double-dog or multi-leashes that resist twisting many of our

your dog by shelby cochran which custom collar is best for your dog if you’re new to the dog world you might be confused when it comes to choosing the right one for your new canine family member there are so many options brands designs and materials - how could you possibly choose the best one especially a custom collar for your dog every dog is a little bit different in what they need the best way to pick the right collar for your pooch is by breaking it down into the different qualities you needstep 1: choose a collar style we’d recommend first deciding which overall type of collar you prefer and/or fits the majority of your needs you need to decide early on what you want the collar to do for your dog are you going to be using it for everyday wear and identification training walking does your dog have collar style requirements for the dog park doggy day care etc here’s a basic breakdown of the main types of dog collars you can choose from: traditional buckle dog collar this is a dog collar with a prong style buckle and collar strap with holes punched in it for adjustment think of it as a human belt buckle this style buckle works well for dogs that wear their collars continuously as these buckles are a bit harder to undo regularly they are commonly found on leather dog collars quick release buckle dog collar this type of collar comes with a plastic or metal buckle that has female and male buckle ends that clasp together generally the buckle will hold tightly when it’s being pulled on but when the side latches are pressed with your fingers the latch mechanism disengages allowing the collar to be removed easily from your dog’s neck a quick release buckle collar is sometimes required at certain boarding and doggy day care facilities because it makes it easy to remove a dog’s collar if they were to get it caught on something or get caught up in any type of chaotic situation requiring quick removal in the cat world there is a variation of this buckle for cat collars called a breakaway buckle collar a breakaway buckle unlatches if enough pulling force is applied to the collar or latch if the collar gets stuck on something and your pet tries to pull away the latch will release and the collar will fall away freeing them much more easily while we do recommend this for cat collars we don’t recommend breakaway buckles for dogs often when dogs put pressure on their collars while on a leash or tie-out the collar coming off could put the dog in serious danger safety or center ring collar this type of collar is common for hunting dogs and other working dogs that are routinely navigating through rugged terrain and obstacles or dogs that have a larger area to roam where they could possibly get stuck on something like a fence or tree branch a safety collar has an o-shaped ring built into the collar about halfway between each end this o-ring provides a pivot point for the collar straps so it doesn’t twist and squeeze your dog’s neck and the pivot point also allows your dog to slip out of the collar more easily if stuck on something that way if your dog gets their collar stuck on something the collar won’t choke them and they can more likely slip out of the collar you can learn more about the safety collar here martingale collar a martingale dog collar is perfect for dogs that back out of their collars often or need correction during training sessions when walking it gives the pet parent a bit more control over your dog martingales are a great alternative to slip or “choke” collars as the amount of cinch is limited and is applied more evenly around your dog’s neck this means martingale collars are much less likely to cause harm to your dog’s trachea when your dog is pulling compared to a slip collar martingales also can actually give your dog a sense of calmness since they apply a moderate even pressure around your dog’s neck when pulled on kind of like a security blanket if you will learn more about martingale collars and how they are used here scrufftag collar the scrufftag collar design is unique to dogids specifically it was developed by our founder clint on any of our custom handmade scrufftag collars the straps of the collar are built into a large rectangular id tag this way the personalization that is engraved onto the scrufftag name plate always rests on the back of the dog’s neck instead of hanging below their mouth if your dog gets lost and a stranger finds them they can easily read the the large deeply engraved contact information engraved on the scrufftag needed to return your pet to you most of the time without even physically contacting your dog to read it some people are intimidated to reach under a dog’s jowls to find a pet id tag or personalized collar buckle for fear of being bitten or drooled on so scrufftag collars eliminate that variable increasing the odds of the finder contacting you and returning your dog additionally our custom scrufftag collars can be made with different types of buckles and materials so that you can design it just the way you want custom dog harness while technically this is not a type of dog collar this is totally an option to consider for your furry friend if you have a dog that is a strong puller or has a delicate neck a harness is a great alternative for walking by putting the pressure of the leash clip on the dog’s body/chest instead of their neck it’s much easier to control them and avoid injurystep 2: choose a dog collar material now that you’ve narrowed down what you need for a collar style it’s time to think about the material you’d like your collar to be made out of you may be looking for a collar purely for looks or you might be looking for durability your dog may have sensitive skin so you need something that won’t exacerbate that issue here’s a breakdown of the different collar materials you can pick from: nylon webbing collar nylon webbing is one of the most common materials dog collars are made with it’s usually less expensive and gives you a lot of options for colors and designs it’s also pliable so a great option for smaller dogs or dogs with more sensitive coats the nylon webbing we use at dogids is a proprietary blend that feels silky soft and is quite thick compared to other nylon colors on the market it took us years of trial and error to find the nylon webbing that we love and trust and once you hold a nylon dogids collar in your hand you’ll definitely feel the difference however nylon is not the perfect material for every dog if you have a dog that spends a lot of time outside or gets wet all the time nylon collars can get pretty dirty and stinky over time they also don’t usually last as long as other sturdier materials like waterproof biothane strap or leather if you like the idea of nylon but your dog has nylon allergies we also have polypropylene webbing or braided rope collars our polypropylene webbing collars have a grosgrain ribbon sewn on the outside of them which is usually embroidered with your personalized contact information so that’s the best way to identify them while browsing our online store waterproof biothane or soft grip collar this urethane and vinyl coated polyester webbing looks and feels very similar to leather with several added benefits not only does it look great and come in tons of colors and patterns even reflective but it is incredibly durable it can hold up to water smells and extreme temperature changes making it a dog owner favorite don’t be fooled by the knockoffs we’ve tried them all and they don’t hold up as well and keep in mind that we’ve been working with biothane strap since the late 90’s through many years of field testing we’ve determined the best variations of biothane strap to make our collars and leashes with which we call soft grip biothane makes hundreds of variations of waterproof strap we use a super heavy version yes it’s more expensive than the biothane strap most of our competitors use but it’s substantially thicker heavier duty and since it’s thicker it has a very nice soft feel to it when you grip it…hence “soft grip” this heavy duty strap also stands up to extreme temperatures and uv light much better which adds years of use without cracking or fading this material is a great fit for active dogs especially water-loving breeds and those pups that love to roll in the stinkiest things they can find it can hold up to pretty much anything your dog can throw at it plus it comes in variations that have reflective strips built right into the collar strap for added safety leather dog collar leather is the traditional material type for dog collars there’s something very elegant and classic about a dog wearing a leather dog collar that being said leather is not just for looks
