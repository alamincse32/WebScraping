search english français español português 简体中文 home blog how a major craft br how a major craft brewer replaced plastic packaging with a paper-based innovation visiting ska brewing’s flagship location in the hills outside downtown durango colo is as much for the experience as it is for its spirited music-and-comic-book-inspired brewschill with your furry four-legged friend in the large outdoor beer garden chow down in the restaurant partly made from two up-cycled shipping containers or venture to the upstairs meeting space for some “happy hour yoga” — just $10 for a class and a pint-sized glass of ska brew to savor when you’re done“it’s a pretty cool draw on a quiet monday night and it’s a great way to start your week especially if it was a hard monday” said ska brewing coo steve breezley for this well-established colorado brewer appreciating the great outdoors and fostering a laid-back lifestyle are at the foundation of its brand and the attitude of its workers and customers as a result its leaders made efforts in past years to embrace a circular economy one based on eliminating pollution and manufacturing products that can be reused or recycled they made environmentally responsible choices to water the lawn with recycled water reduce water consumption in the brewhouses and to put craft beer in recyclable cans instead of glass simply because cans are more likely to end up on a rafting or backpacking trip while there’s a greater chance a canned 6-pack will get put in a mesh bag hooked to a kayak and thrown over the side to stay cool in the river the plastic rings used to pack these cans was for them like that unwanted guest at your childhood birthday party—you didn’t like them but your mom made you invite them anyway and the leaders at ska were determined to disinvite plastic to this outdoor-loving yoga-posing craft-beer-drinking party“our goal is to move away from plastic for sure and just try to minimize materials in general” said breezley but isn’t plastic packaging recyclable and therefore circularit can be recycled but that doesn’t mean it is right now it’s estimated only 15% of the world’s plastic is recycled1 additionally plastic rings are refused by most trash recyclers as they’re considered a “hard-to-recycle plastic one company even made its niche in promising to recycle difficult plastics and according to a bloomberg report they may be failing at it when it comes to plastic in general most trash collectors won’t recycle it because there are no plastic recyclers who’ll take it from them which means they end up throwing it in their landfills2 why most of them used to send plastic recycling to china and without that as an option now recyclers have nowhere else to go there are few domestic partners to choose from because there’s no market for it; recycling plastic is expensive and it’s just cheaper to make more there has to be a better option the founders of ska brewing knew their plastic was ending up in landfills which didn’t sit well with these outdoorsmen “we explored alternatives looking for a solution that would deliver in terms of durability and appearance while also reducing environmental impact” said breezley at the time they found more disappointment than cost-effective solutions the team considered wrapping the entire six-pack in recyclable paperboard traditionally done for 12-packs but they determined that would increase their current cost of production and also the energy and resources needed to produce the packaging another option using plastic can lids would mean that wildlife wouldn’t have to contend with plastic rings but it would increase their usage of single-use plastic the ska brewing team knew there had to be a better way enter westrock a global leader in innovative fiber-based packaging solutions covid slowed down ska’s search and once the pandemic-dust settled the team realized westrock had just released a new alternative called cancollar® this option provided the team with everything they needed and wanted the fiber-based cancollar solution uses approximately 95% less plastic3 while keeping the costs comparable “cancollar immediately reduces the amount of plastic ska contributes to the environment by approximately four tons a year” said breezley “the innovation ethos and ethics behind this solution are what we’re all about” other beverage makers already using cancollar include asahi breweries a japanese-based brewer and mexico-based grupo modelo makers of modelo and corona beer along with more than 150 craft breweries across north america grupo modelo’s transition at their plant in quintana roo is expected to reduce the company’s use of single-use plastic by 100 tons a year4 “it’s exciting to see cancollar helping businesses in the beverage industry meet their sustainable packaging goals” said sam shoemaker westrock president of consumer packaging “these businesses including ska brewing are great examples of how others can replace plastic and make an efficient and smooth transition to fiber-based solutions” ready for sweeping legislation against plastic over 500 municipalities in 28 states have passed some kind of ban or fine on single-use plastics mostly affecting consumers the canadian federal government is taking huge measures to ban the production and import of single-use plastics including six-pack rings by 2025 and europe has also taken a hard stance with the eu banning the sale of many single-use plastics in 2021 such as plastic cutlery plates straws and balloon sticks additionally following maine and oregon colorado passed legislation in may of 2022 requiring manufacturers using certain materials like plastic to fund a statewide recycling program because ska is using westrock’s cancollar packaging the company expects to pay lower dues to the program compared to other craft brewers still using plastic ringscapitalizing on sustainability and technology grants to automate the application of cancollar to its six-packs ska decided to purchase the westrock corsair™ solution for use in its brewery implementing the corsair meant that switching to cancollar would not require more manpower and would allow the team to continue packaging cans at its current rate the machine would also make it possible for ska to package new offerings such as four-packs of their 16-ounce cans to support this major investment ska applied for a colorado state grant aimed at providing funds for “implementing early-stage technology” and it would be the first craft brewery in the country to implement this technology with the added benefit of helping the environment the state’s office of economic development and international trade oedit saw ska brewing as a worthy candidate and awarded them the grant providing a good percentage of their overall investment the oedit made it easier for ska to purchase the corsair and put their new cancollar six-packs on shelves starting in april 2023 “oedits advanced industries accelerator program supports innovative companies that are disrupting their industries and ska brewing is certainly revolutionizing the brewing industry with its packaging technology for environmentally friendly cancollars” said rama haris colorado’s advanced industries senior manager of global business development encouraging sustainability among brewers and beverage manufacturers with the right solution in place ska’s leaders are now able to focus their collective attention on other matters such as new brews and introducing their new four-packs they say they’re not the only ones loving their new packaging “we actually just ran out of our first 16-ounce four-packs” said breezley “when there are 12 ipas in front of you its hard to grab attention cancollar helps set us apart from some of our competitors in a positive way because the feedback weve already had is like ‘i love seeing this its great you guys dont have plastic’” since craft brewers embrace collaboration over competition ska brewing founder dave thibodeau hopes what they’re doing will not only encourage other brewers but also allow them to consult and guide others through the process of making the change to fiber-based packaging “at the end of the day we’d like to see all companies using less plastic so an even better scenario would be if the beer sitting next to ours on the shelf was also using cancollar” westrock

search english français español português 简体中文 home blog recycled fiber vs vi recycled fiber vs virgin fiber while packaging made from 100% recycled material may seem like the optimal choice the need for virgin fiber or fresh material is essential and also supports sustainability businesses big and small are doing their part to reduce waste and limit greenhouse gas emissions by working toward a more sustainable future while there are many ways to advance sustainability one of them is for companies to adopt better more responsible packaging solutions a common thought is that packaging made from 100% recycled material is the optimal choice but in fact the need for virgin fiber or fresh material is essential and also supports sustainability how virgin fiber complements recycled fiber you cant have a sustainable circular economy without a constant supply of high-quality virgin fiber enabling the existence of recycled fiber westrocks virgin fiber or fiber not previously used to produce paper or packaging products is sourced from responsibly managed forests we also partner with organizations like the center for heirs property preservation® to drive social equity through sustainable forestry alternatively our recycled fiber comes from used paper and packaging collected through either westrocks dedicated recycling plants or from partnerships with national haulers while it would be ideal to infinitely reuse fiber-based products the reality is that the fibers in paper and packaging can only be recycled between five and seven times before it becomes unsuitable for most products each time recycled fiber is processed the individual strands drop in quality and strenh without adding fresh fiber into the mix recycled paper and packaging would run out within 8-13 months1 therefore virgin fiber remains vital to a sustainable circular packaging operation supply chain inefficiencies shifting costs and transportation demands are also factors making an environmentally friendly packaging choice can’t be done simply by deciding between recycled or virgin sources instead consider whether the decision makes sense for environmental objectives and whether the supplier supports sustainability throughout the papermaking process how virgin fiber benefits the circular economy sustainable forestry is at the heart of westrocks operations planting trees harvesting them at the right time and converting them into responsible forest products are crucial to a more sustainable future westrock works with partners who consider sustainability every step of the way and operate in areas that are forest positive— that means planting more trees in the procurement basin than what they harvest ensuring the environment remains healthy and productive flourishing sustainable forests confer significant ecological benefits alongside virgin fiber production sustainable forests can directly contribute to: clean water wildlife diversity carbon sequestration recreation: forests often serve as vibrant recreation areas for local communities and westrock has invested in providing access to urban greenspaces beyond these upsides responsibly harvesting forests is also good for the landscapes long-term health when a forest becomes overcrowded with trees the lack of space water and sunlight means the canopy and understory struggle to achieve productive growth without virgin fiber harvesting maximizing regeneration and biodiversity in forested environments can be difficult and fire hazards can also arisehow were driving fiber-based innovation virgin fiber is essential to a sustainable circular economy westrocks forestry practices help to ensure these resources achieve the most benefit: through collaborative relationships with landowners in the us and abroad we provide extensive education guidance and support for sustainable forest management we create economic incentives for private landowners and family tree farmers to continue using their land for working forests ensuring these vast regions provide crucial carbon sequestration freshwater supplies and diverse habitats were driving innovation through smarter fiber-based packaging solutions and closed-loop programs alongside sustainable partnerships with companies like kraft-heinz grupo modelo and swiss chalet grupo modelo: cancollar® westrock worked with grupo modelo to develop cancollar: a durable

companies to deliver packaging solutions that carefully consider natural resources and enhance our response to the changing marketplace as well as consumer interests we helped support kraft-heinz sustainability goals and better reflect consumer demand by developing a recyclable paperboard sleeve for its multi-can products this no-glue innovation uses 50% less material than a traditional wraparound box while reducing co2 emissions by 187% compared to the equivalent shrink-wrap design2 similarly we partnered with iconic mexican brewer grupo modelo on implementing cancollar® – a paperboard-based alternative to plastic rings for beverage multipacks durable enough to withstand the moist conditions inside a brewery this forward-thinking design is expected to reduce plastic waste by more than 100 tons annually3 developing closed-loop systems with general motors commercial operations are also vital to the recycling process with the right approach helping to ensure natural resources are used to their maximum potential westrock recently helped general motors establish a closed-loop recyclable virgin fiber packaging system highlighting how virgin and recycled sources work together to produce sustainable outcomes as a one-stop supplier and recycling partner we produce specially designed fiber-based products for general motors and pick up and move into our mill system almost 17000 tons of recyclable material per year across just five of gm’s plants with the reclaimed virgin materials soon beginning a new life as recycled products this program also supported gm’s zero waste goal to divert greater than 90% of their operational waste from landfills and thermal processing facilities by 2025 westrock is honored to support its customers’ progress toward their sustainability goals while creating less waste and enabling a circular paper-based economy how to choose the right fiber mix westrock offers a diverse range of packaging options including those that use 100% recycled fiber a range of questions can help businesses select sustainable packaging that also achieve business objectives and fulfills environmental needs: know whats driving the need: consider the reasons for choosing a fully recycled product from customer expectations to industry standards motivation might determine which product makes the most sense consider the intended use: recycled paper-based products can be a great choice but the intended application matters strenh and durability demands influence the ideal packaging decisionexplore options: while many of westrocks products are 100% recyclable others feature a combination of virgin and recycled fiber to improve longevity and performance get to know the range of options drive innovation: if there isn’t a 100%
