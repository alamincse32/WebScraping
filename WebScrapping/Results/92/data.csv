undoubtedly increase cost and downtime slowing your technicians down and leaving you and your aircraft grounded industries serviced: commercial aircraft military aviation oem research & development helicopters how do aviation hydraulic systems work aviation hydraulic systems rely on an enclosed system with pressurized hydraulic fluid to change the position of aircraft parts such as ailerons cargo doors wing flaps or landing gear hydraulic systems rely on the principle of fluid mechanics in physics called pascal’s law which states that a pressure change in one part is transmitted without loss to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the containerwhen a pilot or engineer flips an electronic switch in the cockpit this activates a pump in the hydraulic system which then applies pressure to an actuator consequently moving a component like an aileron or cargo door by utilizing the natural laws of physics what seems like a complex operation translates to a relatively simple process with the helping hand of a hydraulic system aeronautical hydraulic system components hydraulic fluid hydraulic fluid is a specialized liquid used in hydraulic systems to transmit power and lubricate components enabling smooth and efficient operation of hydraulic machinery hydraulic cylinders hydraulic cylinders are mechanical devices that convert hydraulic energy into linear force and motion playing a crucial role in various applications from heavy machinery to aircraft control systems hydraulic motors hydraulic motors are devices that convert hydraulic pressure into rotational mechanical power providing the driving force for numerous applications such as conveyor belts winches and heavy equipment hydraulic pumps hydraulic pumps are essential components in hydraulic systems that generate fluid flow and pressure to drive hydraulic cylinders and motors enabling the transfer of energy within the system hydraulic plumbing hydraulic plumbing refers to the network of pipes hoses and fittings that transport hydraulic fluid throughout a hydraulic system ensuring the proper distribution of pressure and fluid to various components hydraulic reservoirs storage for hydraulic fluid they are designed to accommodate the changing volume of hydraulic fluid due to temperature changes from normal engine functions hydraulic accumulators this pressurizes the hydraulic fluid which then has multiple functions it can maintain pressure distribute pressure to where its needed and capture excess pressure hydraulic valves hydraulic valves are used to control the flow of hydraulic

repair and overhaul mro station is designed for superior engineering performance adhering to oem requirements for aircraft pneumatic systems including pneumatic valves starters air cycle machines and pneumatic drive units industries serviced: commercial aircraft military aviation oem research & development helicopters how do aircraft pneumatic systems work aircraft pneumatic systems use compressed air to perform various functions critical to the operation of an aircraft the pneumatic system is typically powered by engine bleed air which is extracted from the engine’s compressor section the compressed air is then used to direct energy to operate the movement of certain aircraft components typical functions for the aircraft’s pneumatic system include: air conditioning cabin pressurization flight control systems for control surfaces like ailerons elevators and rudders landing gear anti-icing and deicing pressure regulation and distribution other systems such as starting systems for certain engines cabin door operation and air-driven hydraulic pumps advancements in aircraft technology such as the introduction of more electric aircraft mea have led to a reduction in the reliance on pneumatic systems in some modern aircraft however many traditional aircraft still rely on pneumatic systems for their critical functions aircraft pneumatic system components pneumatic systems in aircraft are essential for various functions such as controlling flight surfaces landing gear and pressurization here are ten common pneumatic system components found in aircraft: air compressor the air compressor is responsible for compressing the ambient air to provide the required pressure for the pneumatic system pressure regulator the pressure regulator maintains a steady and controlled output pressure from the air compressor to ensure consistent operation of the pneumatic system air receiver reservoir the air receiver also known as a reservoir stores compressed air to provide a buffer and maintain a stable supply during peak demands check valve a check valve allows the flow of compressed air in one direction only preventing backflow and maintaining system pressure integrity shut-off valve a shut-off valve is used to isolate specific sections of the pneumatic system for maintenance or in emergencies pressure relief valve the pressure relief valve protects the pneumatic system from overpressure situations by releasing excess air when the pressure exceeds a predetermined limit solenoid valve solenoid valves are electromechanical valves that use an electric current to control the flow of compressed air to actuate various pneumatic devices pneumatic actuators these are devices that convert the pressure of compressed air into mechanical motion used for tasks such as operating flight control surfaces and landing gear pneumatic filters filters are employed to remove contaminants moisture and other impurities from the compressed air ensuring clean and reliable operation of the system components pressure gauges pressure gauges provide real-time information about the pressure levels in the pneumatic system allowing for monitoring and troubleshooting
