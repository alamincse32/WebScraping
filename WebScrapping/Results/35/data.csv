foundationresponsible delivery thats who we are building an american icon when anheuser-busch was founded in the 1850s it started as a small neighborhood brewery through the combined efforts of eberhard anheuser adolphus busch and thousands of employees our brewery quickly transformed from a local fixture into a national presence today we employ thousands of people nationwide all united by a deep passion for dreaming big and supporting the communities that we call home 1870s adolphus busch a german immigrant arrived in the united states in 1857 by 1861 adolphus had married lilly anheuser the daughter of local businessman eberhard anheuser after serving in the union army during the civil war adolphus went to work at his father-in-lawâs brewery and begins building a brand that would become an american icon 1870s anheuser-busch becomes the first american brewery to use pasteurization allowing beer to be shipped long distances without spoiling 1870s anheuser-buschâs use of new technologies like pasteurization artificial refrigeration refrigerated railcars and rail-side ice house allowed budweiser to become the first nationally distributed beer brand today budweiser is brewed in 12 locations across the us an at more than 50 breweries around the world for the love of lager the introduction of lager beer to the united states by german immigrants during the mid-19th century forever changed the landscape of the brewing industry as lager became the most popular style of beer we pioneered the use of new technologies allowing consumers across america to enjoy beers like michelob faust and budweiser our time-honored traditions of brewing the highest quality beer while constantly innovating has pushed the future of our industry forward the birth of lager in the mid-1800s the population of st louis exploded as a large wave of german immigrants settled in the city one of the principal industries that germans brought to st louis was brewing these german brewers introduced a style of beer popular in germany but relatively unknown in the united states: lager beer eberhard anheuser from soap to beer eberhard anheuser â a german soap maker who would go on to own the largest soap and candle company in st louis â emigrated to missouri in 1843 although he had no brewing experience eberhard became part owner of the bavarian and by 1860 had bought out the other investors changing the breweryâs name to e anheuser & co adolphus busch - a historic partnership adolphus busch was born in 1839 the second youngest of 22 children at the age of 18 he made his way to st louis via new orleans and the mississippi river adolphus began working as a clerk on the riverfront and by the time he was 21 he had a partnership in a brewing supply business it was through this enterprise that adolphus busch met eberhard anheuser â and his daughter lilly a fortunate love story in 1861 adolphus busch and eberhard anheuserâs daughter lilly were married shortly after that adolphus went to work for his father-in-law at e anheuser & co later purchasing half of the brewery an americon icon is born adolphusâ vision and entrepreneurial mindset grew the business both in the us and abroad â no small feat at the time in 1879 the company was renamed the anheuser-busch brewing association to recognize his efforts when eberhard anheuser died in 1880 adolphus became president of the brewery in 1901 the company broke the 1 million barrels of beer sales mark for the first time making it one of the nationâs leading breweries crowning a king when adolphus began working at the brewery most beer in the united states was sold and consumed in the community in which it was brewed but adolphus was determined to create a brand that would transcend the tradition of local brews and appeal to people across the us in 1876 adolphus and his friend carl conrad created budweiser an american-style lager that succeeded beyond anyoneâs expectations and eventually became the breweryâs flagship brand: sales & marketing center stage in addition to being a leader in the technical development of the brewing industry adolphus busch was also a master of advertising and promotion adolphus used traditional proven selling methods but in a far more organized and deliberate manner than his competitors he pioneered the use of giveaways and in the 1880s turned the

every drop of beer meets our exacting standards rice for a crisp clean finish rice is an extremely high-quality brewing adjunct we use to help lighten the body of many of our beers and give them a subtle sweetness with a crisp fast refreshing finish adolphus busch first added rice to budweiser to set it apart from other lagers â and today we continue that tradition in fact we are the largest end user of rice in the united states and even mill some of our supply at our rice mill in jonesboro ar yeast: the life of beer yeast is a very important and often underestimated contributor to the
