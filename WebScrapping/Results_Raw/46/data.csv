Do not let short, weather damaged or late season harvesting cause even more yield loss by poor feeding or shattering at the cutter bar. Maximize your crops potential by adding Crary® Wind System (CWS) to your header. By adding a CWS, you can continue using your factory reel while experiencing the profit saving benefits of adding a stream of air over your cutter bar. This high velocity air will keep the crop moving quickly into the header, either back to the auger or right onto the draper belt. The CWS features powder coat paint. This not only protects the components, it reduces the troublesome sun glare from the aluminum components. Every bean and kernel count towards your profitability, with a CWS you will have the power of air on your side. The CWS is equipped with a range of features: 8 inch Crary fan with rotary screen 8 inch aluminum tube 36 inch and 42 inch long, alternating drop tubes, with added gussets for extra strength Fits most major brands of headers Powder coat paint for extra durability and helps reduce troublesome sun glare What makes the CWS - Crary Wind System so different? Sectional Manifolds: The manifold on a Crary Wind System is built in sections. This is a big advantage because it makes our systems easier to ship - which will save you money. Plus, if a section of the CWS is ever damaged you can simply remove that section and replace it. Again saving you even more money! Heavy Duty Support: The Crary Manifolds are supported by heavy duty flanged joints. There are no cables running through our manifold, which can disrupt your air performance. In challenging harvest conditions you need to ensure you maximize your system's performance. Simply put, Crary gives you more! Self-contained fan assembly: We have the technology to mount our reliable systems to your harvester's head/platform. This offers you the ability to use your head and Air System with different harvesters. Plus, if you trade-in or replace your harvester, our systems are self-contained. This can save you hundreds of dollars if your dealer does not have to spend time removing the fan from the harvester. Support after the Sale: We know how important Uptime is in today's market. That's why you can have the piece of mind that Crary is dedicated to Service and Support. Our systems not only carry a warranty, gauranteed to protect against manufacturing defects, but we work hard all year long to ensure our Service & Parts departments are equipped to handle daily challenges. That way, You Can Count on Crary! Faster Ground Speeds Most owners and operators of a Crary Wind System report higher ground speeds due to the fact that they no longer have to wait for bunched crop to clear the platform. With faster ground speeds come higher profits and reduced fuel expenses. A Variety Of Crops Types of crop and the condition of the crop are not a concern for CWS owners. Many report that they can move between fields while making no adjustments to their header. The benefits of high velocity air are being realized in many different crop harvests: wheat, lentils and beans are just a few. Long Lasting The Crary high pressure fan utilizes a steel rotor. Natural dust and dirt particles can be coarse and abbrasive, having a steel rotor will increase the longevity of your air system. Series II Gearbox™ The Crary Wind System now comes equipped with a Series II Gearbox. Features of the Series II inlcude: -Simplified Design -Reduced weight, sound and operating temperature -Improved field serviceability -Increased power transmission allows Crary to move more air with a single fan ""I forgot how nice the CWS fed the crop into the combine until I was given the opportunity to drive a new combine and head with just a conventional reel.

We've been developing our air systems for more than 20 years, which means at Crary ""We definitely know Air flow"". We also know, that the most efficient thrashing comes from an evenly fed harvester. A constant, even flow of material in, leads to the most efficient grain separation. Poor feeding, bunching at the cutter bar and crop simply shattering or falling off the leading edge can literally leave your profit in the field. Add an Air Reel® and you will add bushels to the hopper. A constant stream of high velocity air quickly feeds crop back to either the auger or right onto the draper belt, eliminating bunching. The Crary Air Reel offers a better view of the cutter bar for improved visibility. The Air Reel also features powder coat paint. Faster Ground Speeds Most owners and operators of a Crary Air Reel report higher ground speeds due to the fact that they no longer have to wait for bunched crop to clear the platform.

Reinhold Delzer saw a need for combine attachments that helped farmers harvest sunflower seeds. To manufacture these attachments and provide machining services for area Ag businesses he founded the Delzer Machine Shop. In 1979 the health of the company founder led to the sale of his company to Chuck and Joe Crary. Neither Chuck, a certified public accountant for a regional accounting firm, nor Joe, a real estate broker and developer, had any experience in manufacturing, but like the pioneers before them they took a chance. Shortly after selling the Company Reinhold Delzer died. Lacking experience the new owners turned to another valued northern plains trait: cooperation. They knew if they surrounded themselves with good people the company would prosper. In a manner similar to that of a traditional barn raising, they sought out people in the community to help. Mechanical engineering students at N.D. State University helped design and draft equipment. Moorhead State students were brought in to help market and advertise. Members of Service Corp Of Retired Executives (SCORE) provided purchasing and management insight. The lead person in setting up the manufacturing process was Bill Kohler, a retired tool and die maker. His dedication, long hours and ability to make use of limited resources were instrumental in getting the company going. Humble Beginnings In the beginning there were two owners, two employees, a run down steel building with little heat, and no running water. However the company had products; sunflower and edible bean harvesting attachments, and Anhydrous applicators, that satisfied the needs of those for whom the company was organized- its customers. From these humble beginnings the company was able to make a profit and grow as more and more customers wanted the products being manufactured. To better meet the needs of its customers, operations were moved to the present West Fargo plant site where a modest 6000 square foot building, with running water, was erected. The company's name was changed to Delzer-Crary Company and in 1981 it was shortened to Crary Company. The company continued to grow. Growth that the organization be flexible and expand its customer base. Crary Company has manufactured multiple products for a variety of different industries. In addition to the sunflower and bean harvesting aids came cutting attachments for combines and swathers, and high-pressure fans. A line of outdoor power equipment: snowblowers, chipper-shredders and composters was added, and the Bear Cat line of Outdoor Power Equipment was born. Custom job shop projects were taken on: fireplaces, exercise equipment, etc. After a number of consecutive years of growth, the Company was sold to an investment firm in 1999 whose strategy was to facilitate growth through acquisitions. Crary Company became part of a group of other manufacturers under the corporate name of TerraMarc Industries. The other manufacturers all specialized in Potato planting, harvesting, and handling equipment, and the combination made TerraMarc the leading Potato Equipment manufacturer in North America. One of those companies was Lockwood, with a manufacturing legacy dating back to 1935. Based in Nebraska in outdated facilities, the decision was made to double the size of Crary Company to 200,000 square feet and move the Lockwood product line to West Fargo in 2001. In the years since, the company was able to stabilize its market share as one of two dominant domestic manufacturers of Potato equipment and penetrate new international markets. Greeting the Future Two of the Potato Companies: Mayo Mfg and Harriston Industries were re-sold in 2005 to their employees, setting the stage for the sale of the Crary Company to ECHO Incorporated of Lake Zurich, IL and creating a new company named Crary Industries. ECHO's focus on hand held power equipment, and it's strong distribution channels were a natural compliment to the Bear Cat line of Chipper-Shredders. With the development of sales channels for the Power Equipment, Crary continues to make quality products for the agricultural market, and also Potato Planters and Harvesters under the Lockwood Brand. Throughout its history, the company's focus on customers and its flexibility and ability to diversify has resulted in continued growth and recognition in its community, and the markets served.
