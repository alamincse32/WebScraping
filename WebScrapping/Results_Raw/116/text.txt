The PDS is a reliably-based design system for wood pallets. The Pallet Design System is used to estimate pallet strength, deformation, and durability. The figures and information are generated from user-specified descriptions of the pallet and its handling environment. Pro pallet uses this information to estimate the performance level of a specific pallet design, and it allows us to generate a safe pallet that works for your companies needs.
