Our Story Seth and Haylee Houkom were born and raised in West Fargo, ND where Power Plate Meals all began. The couple had a dream to create a place where people could grab a healthy, balanced meal that was not only fresh, calorie friendly, and packed with flavor, but also convenient for the busy individual and family. They wanted people to know that eating healthy tastes good, and wanted to provide that experience for their community and customers. Thanks to all of you, Power Plate Meals became a reality and we couldn't be more thankful that you make our meals a part of your everyday healthy, busy lifestyle.

LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR WHOLESALE MEALS At Power Plate Meals, our mission is to make healthy eating easy for everyone. More and more people are becoming conscious of what they put in their bodies and that’s why we make our meals clean label, with only the best ingredients. From busy professionals and families to individuals with food sensitivities, we have meal options for everyone, including gluten-free, dairy-free, and plant-based. Our meals are made fresh in West Fargo, ND in our commercial kitchen. We are fully USDA & FDA-certified and are hungry to grow! Why do our customers choose us over other meal options? The most popular answer is that our meals actually taste good. We can confidently say we have the best-tasting, ready-to-eat meals in the market with clean, simple ingredients. Another reason is that our meals are truly packed with protein, averaging 30+ grams per meal. Our meals are balanced with 3-4 oz. of cooked protein with a healthy balance of carbs and fat. Unlike other pre-packaged meal options that contain fillers and only 20g protein, our meals are balanced with 3-4oz of cooked protein and a healthy mix of carbs and fat. WHOLESALE FAQ'S WHERE CAN YOU PURCHASE THEM? Please see map for location reference ARE THE WHOLESALE MEALS THE SAME AS THE IN STORE MENUS? Wholesale meals that can be found at other businesses are a select menu. DO THE WHOLESALE MEALS CHANGE BI-WEEKLY? Our wholesale meals do not rotate bi-weekly like our in store and online menus do. HOW DO I HEAT THEM UP? Remove label and microwave meal, with plastic film still intact, for 4-5 minutes if frozen or 1.5-2.5 minutes if thawed, or temperature reaches at least 165˚F. Remove plastic film after heating. Caution steam. INTERESTED IN SELLING POWER PLATE MEALS? Wholesale meals are distributed by us and sold at other businesses nationwide.
