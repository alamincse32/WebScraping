In other cases, there may be an enclosure in place that is adequate, buy might need a few modifications such as blast resistant hinges, or door locks. Regardless, our extensive experience in engineering and building bunkers allows us to do a full risk assessment. We provide a full write up that includes: Observations Risk Assessment Recommendations Careful attention is given to three main areas: Safety Productivity Best Use of Shop Space Engineering of Certified Testing Enclosure Our enclosures are engineer designed, certified, and guaranteed.
