The name D&M was chosen to represent our heritage of doing business in the Dakotas and Minnesota. In the beginning years, D&M specialized in doors, frames and hardware for motels and apartment building. The company started out small with seven employees and was located at 1426 40th Street NW in Fargo ND. In the fall of 1989, D&M was sold to private investors and within one year began diversifying by adding a residential division. With this expansion, windows and a variety of millwork items were added to the product lines. At the same time, the commercial division developed additional business to include more hotel/motel and multi-family projects in areas outside the traditional tri-state region. By 1993 D&M had 25 employees and had exceeded capacity of the 40th Street location. A move to a 20,000 square foot building at 2401 Third Avenue N in Fargo ND was completed. Within the next ten years, D&M expanded into two additional properties in the 2400 block of Third Street. Experts in Quality Products D&M Strives To Help You Not long after the final expansion on Third Street did it become evident the company would be on the move again. This time the move was across the Red River into Minnesota where a great new facility totaling 63,000 square feet took shape in 2006. D&M now had room for the warehouse and production areas in one location which includes an outstanding showroom and office area. In 2014 D&M once again expanded by moving a majority of the warehouse operations into a new 43,000 square foot facility located at 4130 34th Avenue South in Moorhead. This allowed for expansion of the production areas and new equipment to improve quality and increase output. By this time the staff was over 120 employees and the company had diversified into nationwide shipping of product to the same and additional sectors including hospitality, multi-family residential, assisted living, educational institutions and single-family residential. Expanding Services Growing With Our Customers In 2018 D&M finalized its first acquisition and added a prefinishing company to the mix of product and service offerings. Prefinishing was a natural addition to service since more and more projects were requiring the delivery of a prefinished product ready for installation. Capital Finishing came to D&M with two locations. One in Belleville, WI and the other in Oregon, WI. The company had been in the finishing business since 1965 and was a perfect fit as an added service. Capital Finishing can prefinish almost any product but specializes in interior and exterior doors and jambs, molding and trim, cabinet and closet components, staircase parts and boards. In the later parts of the year, the dramatic increase in commercial/multi-family business and awarding of some large contracts once again called for more warehouse space. This time the organization choose to enter into a lease agreement for an additional 13,000 square feet of space close to the main warehouse. The economic pressures of 2021 and price increases along with increased commercial business once again called for more warehouse space. Another 13,000 square feet were leased at the end of 2021 to help ease the overcrowding and improve efficiencies in the warehouse operations. D&M began its 40th year in business in 2022 with 170 employee-owners in Minnesota and Wisconsin and three remote employees in other states across the country. The acquisition of Midwest Window and Door in Mound MN added another dimension to the D&M business portfolio and 7 more employees. Thanks to the great employee-owners, vendors and all of the outstanding and loyal customers, D&M continues to grow. In 2009, D&M provided doors, frames and hardware for a motel project in Alaska! This project gave D&M their 49th state – give us a call Hawaii! D&M can make it happen. © 2023 D & M Industries. | Created by Off The Wall Advertising | Privacy Policy Close Menu Doors/Frames/Hardware/Windows Commercial Portfolio Hospitality Portfolio Corporate Office Portfolio Living Communities Portfolio Doors & Frames Interior Doors Exterior Doors Frames Millwork, Mouldings, & Stairparts Windows Finish Hardware Hardware Electronic Hardware Specialty Items Residential Portfolio Doors & Frames Interior Doors Exterior Doors Millwork Mouldings Stairparts Windows Finish Hardware Prefinishing Midwest Window Historical Renovation/Retrofit Gallery Multi-Family Gallery Contact Make a Payment About Us Leadership Team Office Hours and Holidays Corporate Location D&M Brochure Resources Warranties Careers (800) 437-4305"
