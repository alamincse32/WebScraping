Products Tillage | Joker RX Joker RXSince HORSCH introduced the first high speed compact disc concept to North America, the Joker Series has become a necessary tool on many farms throughout the continent. Whether working in no-till, minimum-till, or conventional till farming practices, the Joker adds time-efficiency within the optimum agronomic work windows for residue management and precise seedbed preparation. Its proven advantages over vertical tillage, tandem disc, field cultivators, and other shallow tillage concepts has revolutionized the North American tillage market. The Joker RX is a brand new Joker platform which enhances performance while maintaining superior working action and tillage quality. When coming up with this concept, we wanted to increase throughput for variable field conditions while providing versatility and agility with a vertical tillage conversion. Being the pioneer and designing the first high speed compact disk in north America comes with responsibility to continue advancing and holding the highest rank. We have started this in 2008, and have advanced that platform into the best yet, 4th generation of Joker - Joker RX. Watch to learn more! RollFlex has evolved into the new RingFlex system. Same finishing and working quality of RollFlex with enhanced performance in variable field conditions. New frame design utilizes pivot pins instead of poly bushings for easier servicing.14% more distance between front and rear row of discs vs previous RT modelNew mono arm design is 66% longer for added through-put than previous RT model. Joker RX features MonoArm, a single blade per rubber torsion mounted arm with reliable, minimum maintenance bearings which: Maintain precise blade angle engagement during tillage operation.Creates ideal, uniform working horizon during seedbed preparation.Aggressively sizes and blends plant residues with a fine soil structure. The OptiRoll packer option at rear of machine provides a firmed and uniform soil structure which: Optimizes performance in variable soil conditionsincluding different soil types, residue, and tones.Incorporates a poly-based center with rubber ribs and precision scraper, combined provide superior cleaning in high moisture soil conditions. Joker RX series features 17 front/17 rear degree blade angles on MonoArm that: Provide uniform and thorough horizontal soil tilth during seedbed preparation. Maintains consistent soil engagement and draft in variable soil conditions.Creates aggressive working action when sizing tough residues. Uniformity and Consistency Blade angle and mounting design ensures consistent soil engagement and provides uniform working action across the machine. Consistent thorough horizontal fracture creates uniform soil structure, level working horizon, and provides uniform mixing of sized residue and soil, all foundations of an optimum seedbed. Uniform soil working action maximizes efficacy of pre-emerge herbicides, thorough incorporation of granular fertilizers and manure while providing optimum seedbed soil structure. Residue Utilization Maximize the agronomic benefits of post-harvest residue by promoting accelerated decomposition. Intense residue sizing provides more “open doors” for soil bacteria and fungi to initialize the residue decomposition process. Unlock the nutrient and organic matter values remaining in post-harvest residues to benefit the nutritional needs of future crops. Promote healthy crop environment by rapidly decomposing residue that harbor pathogens and dangerous pests. Soil Consolidation Unique technique used during soil preparation that creates optimum seedbed environment. Consolidation promotes capillary affect in the soil, which uniformly draws and maintains moisture in the seedbed and seed zone. Uniform moisture in the seed zone ensures rapid seedling germination and uniform emergence, which are two key principals to establishing maximum yield potentials. Joker RX creates a consistent, firm soil structure across the working width of the machine which optimizes seed placement performance of planters and seeders. It provides optimum soil to residue contact, which aids in accelerating residue decomposition. Joker RX versus traditional vertical tillage(L) Vertical Tillage vs. (R) Joker RX. The Joker RX incorporates and promotes decomposition for release of valuable plant nutrients vs. loss to wind and water while providing a perfect working horizon across working width of machine. Joker RX versus traditional vertical tillage concept:The Joker provides more aggressive residue sizing and thorough mixing of residue within the soil, creating an aerobic environment suited for residue decomposition.The Joker sizes and mixes residue thoroughly in consolidated soil to help it decompose more rapidly. This releases N-P-K and micronutrients, and increases organic matter levels for future cropping.The sized and mixed residue within the consolidated soil is stable with less chance of movement by nature (wind and water). In contrast, vertical tillage systems generally leave the nutrient-rich residue on the surface to blow away. (Left) Joker RX - (Right) Vertical Tillage Joker RX versus traditional tandem/offset disk:The Joker provides a much smoother field finish, compared to the ridges, lumps, slabbing, and uneven depth of traditional disks.With the Joker, there is no need for multiple passes to “clean up the mess” of a rough, uneven field.Higher tillage speeds and more action in one pass allows the Joker to be overall more efficient without sacrificing tillage quality. Advantages The Joker RX Series high-speed compact disc makes an ideal precision tool for both primary tillage and secondary tillage. Since it’s pioneering of the high-speed compact disc in the North American market, the Joker has proven to be not only a very versatile tool in many cropping situations but also necessary tool when working in adverse conditions.Advantages in Primary Tillage ApplicationsRecondition and level fields after harvest as a first step to next seasons seedbed.Excellent for sizing, incorporating, and mulching post-harvest residues to kick-start decomposition.Effectively secures residue to prevent losses due to wind.Sustainable post-harvest weed control.Proven for use in terminating a wide variety of cover crops.Leveling action helps with field conditioning by eliminating of ruts, clumps, furrows, ridges, raised beds, and conditions after root crop harvesting.Depth is gauged by the RollFlex finishing system, providing full-width depth control for precise tillage.Advantages in Secondary Tillage / Seedbed Preparation ApplicationsCreates ideal seedbed for higher speed planting and seeding.Creates uniform soil structure and density that enhances seed placement performance of seeders and planters.Ideal complementary concept for single pass seedbed preparation following disc rippers, moldboard plows, chisel plows, or sub-soilers.Provides additional residue sizing / incorporation to promote accelerated decomposition, unlocking nutrient value of residue for future crop growth.Thoroughly incorporates spread granular fertilizer and enhances the efficacy of pre-emerge herbicide applications.Sustainably control early season weed pressures through thorough horizontal tillage.Firms and secures soil through consolidation to prevent wind erosion.

Products Tillage | Omnis FT Omnis FTThe cultivator Omnis FT represents the launch of a new primary tillage concept focusing on thorough profile tillage. Based upon proven principles of European primary tillage techniques, the Omnis FT integrates these intensive cultivation principles into a versatile domestic platform. Unique frame design offers versatile options for all soil types/conditions. Proven MulchMix Technology gives the ability to loosen soil at a maximum depth of 10-12 inches, lifting soil and mixing the entire soil profile both horizontally and vertically, resulting in the ultimate thorough horizontal fracture. Complete profile tillage creates a uniform and consistent soil structure throughout the entire soil profile, eliminating restrictions on root growth and improving overall soil dynamics.TerraGrip III with the MulchMix system. The heart of the unique thorough profile tillage. A wide variety of finishing systems such as the rolling basket, are available pending the desired soil conditioning finish.The finishing system is hydraulically controlled to achieve a consistent finish. In unsatisfactory conditions, it can be operated in the lifted positon adding to the versatiity. Omnis FT Focused on primary tillage down to 10-12 inches, Omnis FT features our high performing patented TerraGrip III shanks on 15 inch spacing to achieve consistent horizontal fracture across entire width of machine. Built to suit any operation, the Omnis FT can be configured with many different points and finishing systems. Watch to learn more! Horsch unveils tillage equipment Uniformity and Consistency After harvest, primary tillage is the next determining dynamic to affect seedbed quality for the next crop. Creating an unrestrictive soil structure profile is essential for maximum root growth potential, water infiltration, and root accessibility to nutrient base, which all in turn secure maximum crop yield potentials. Thorough profile tillage provides a uniform and consistent soil structure across the full working width and to the working depth which creates an unrestrictive soil profile. Residue incorporation is important during primary tillage to accelerate decomposition. Mixing residue uniformly in the aerobic soil zone allows soil bacteria and fungi to accelerate decomposition, unlocking the fertilizer nutrient value of the residue and eliminating host environments for pathogens. Uniform residue distribution within the upper soil profile protects soil with adequate cover and creates an optimum prelude to seedbed preparation. Versatility Not every farm is the same. Different conditions require different tools. The ability to work at both shallow depths and deeper depths adds versatility to the Omnis FT concept. A wide variety of finishing systems are available including rolling baskets or 3 bar harrows, solo or in combination with leveling tines or leveling discs, can be adapted to the rear of the unit. Rear hitch options are available if a tow-implement is desired. Cutting coulter option is available if conditions include residue that has been unprepared or unsized at harvest. These coulters are attached in front of each shank to maximize material throughout and keeps the machine balanced. Large tires on the chassis ensure excellent floatation in softer soils and during seasons where moisture can limit tillage efficiency. Residue Utilization By providing a deep loosening action along with soil lift, the MulchMix system incorporates crop residues uniformly within the aerobic soil zone. Soil bacteria and fungi have the optimum environment to start breakdown and accelerate decomposition of the residue. Rather than simply managing the residue, residue is utilized for its fertilizer nutrient value and quickly decomposed to eliminate host areas for pathogens. Advantages of Omnis FT Achieve thorough horizontal fracture and thorough profile tillage at a variety of working depths from 4-5 inches up to 10-12 inches.Excellent performance in field conditions where harvest residues have been processed with combine/header or shredded.Incorporate residue within the aerobic soil zone for accelerated decomposition.Creation of an unrestrictive root environment along with improved oxygen and water infiltration.Variety of finishing and leveling options to suit desired soil conditioning.MulchMix system combines perfect geometry with proven trip mechanism, shank, selection of points, and wing sweeps for superior primary tillage.TerraGrip III trip mechanism and shanks on 15 inch spacing for thorough horizontal fracture and are rated at 1800 lbs trip force for precise engagement.35 degree point-angle of engagement to create maximum lifting action and deep loosening in the tilled profile.Optional wing sweeps can be installed for shallow primary tillage for weed control and uniform tillage profile.Right and left hand curved mixing boards direct lifted soil further upward, creating thorough soil mixing action across the full profile width.Simple depth adjustment, zero lubrication points on trip mechanisms, and overall easy to maintain.

The trip height lifts to 11 inches without triggering a shear bolt, which saves time and money. Due to the effective rock protection the shank moves quickly in case of overload and due to the spring force penetrates the soil again quickly and accurately – without the usual side movements. When avoiding an obstacle, the force of the spring decreases from 1200 lb to 380 lb. The force that acts on the frame is reduced considerably. The optimised spring kit allows for an exact point control in the desired working depth – even in heavy soils and large working depths. Due to high-quality material and large pivot points any greasing points become unnecessary. TerraGrip III Illustration Shown above is the action of the TerraGrip III 1200 lb release force with an 11 inch trip height. When releasing the force decreases to 380 lb reducing the stress on the frame. Shown below are the different optional shank MultchMix points.

Products Seeding | Pronto AS The Pronto 6 AS allows for using the seed wagon with front tools in combination with the TurboDisc-tyre packer combination or the Maestro RV. If the TurboDisc coulter attachment is used for row seeding, high operational speeds up to 20 km/h and thus high hectare outputs are possible. The well-proven Pronto principle seedbed preparation, consolidation and seeding guarantees highest precision in seed placement and safe and high emergence. The Pronto 6 AS can be combined with a Maestro RV for sowing row crops (e.g. maize and beets). The singulation system of the Maestro guarantees that the crops is sown with the single-grain system and that the seed wagon of the Pronto 6 AS can be used for fertiliser. The preliminary disc harrow for seedbed preparation and for the levelling of the tractor tracks is an additional asset. The changeover between the TurboDisc coulter attachment and the Maestro RV can be carried out easily and quickly via the integrated 3-point interface of the Pronto 6 AS. The Pronto 6 AS can be equipped with a large single hopper (3 500 l) for a long range. A double hopper (5 000 l) for placing seed and fertiliser is available as an option. The fertiliser can either be placed together with the seed (G & F) or as a separate underground fertilisation (PPF) beside the row. The chassis of the Pronto 6 AS is equipped with a separate axle. All turning manoeuvres and road transports are carried out on large tyres (800 / 45 – 26.5). In working position the tyres in connection with the TurboDisctyre packer combination are lifted completely so that the targeted consolidation is carried out by the tyre packer. If the Maestro RV is used, the transport wheels reliably carry the weight of the seed wagon.

Seeding precision starts with tank design. Proper angle of repose insures proper product flow to the meter. Positive cleanout sump design always keeps meter properly filled and allows for quick thorough clean out when changing between products. Globally proven electric motor drive metering system provides industry leading calibration and rate accuracy. Smooth routing and transition of primary hoses up to the seed towers maintain uniform product flow. Precisely engineered air tower technology concentrates product flow uniformly upward towards the distribution manifold. Having this uniform flow directed up the center of the air tower is imperative to accurately distribute product volume evenly to each manifold port that leads to opener. All distribution manifold hosing has a consistent downward routing to the openers, free of any loops or drastic directional changes to insure precise volume output per opener and uniform product flow. Weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar which in turn stabilizes the row units for consistent soil engagement and precise depth control. Precise furrow creation and seed placement by the opener along with firming sets the stage for uniform emergence and overall crop uniformity. Weight transfer system also aids in eliminating pinch rows created by wheel tracks, leaving a uniform and consistent soil structure for placement of each seed. Simplistic Operation The heart of the Avatar SD’s design comes from a keep it simple, minimum maintenance mindset. Full implement operation is done through an ISOBUS control system. Use ISO virtual terminals to control the unit, fold/unfold, for calibration, and for precision farming applications. Simple and ultra-accurate product calibrations are easily accomplished with the flip of a switch. Openers use an exclusive rubber torsion mount design, eliminating pivot pins, bushings, and grease points. In fact, lubrication of the unit consists of 8 total grease points. All opener adjustments can be made from the rear of the unit, setting the toolbar at desired height for adjustments. Transport is simplified at only 12’ wide for safe travel on roadways.

Products Seeding Shank type seeders | Sprinter SW Sprinter SW Sprinter Flexibility, The way to seed todayHORSCH. Working side by side with farmers Specialisation, growth, cooperation: due to rapid changes in agriculture, manufacturers of agricultural equipment are facing new challenges. Optimising the cultivation, seeding and harvesting process, reducing costs as well as increasing yields and quality of crops are our prime goals. As an innovative pioneer, HORSCH has become one of the leading manufacturers of cultivation and seeding technology. New technological standards are rigorously tested in our trials – standards of quality, precision and durability. HORSCH advises farmers on the development of individual cropping systems and farming strategies. Together with our distributors and service agents HORSCH aims to provide the best customer service by ensuring that repairs are carried out swiftly and that spare parts are always available.Soil preparation, seeding, fertilisation, consolidation The Sprinter ST is a tine seeder that combines soil preparation, seeding and fertilisation in one pass. The robust Sprinter has clear advantages in min-till conditions, with lots of straw residues still remaining on the soil surface. Strong frame design, low draft coulters and large seed hoppers allow high performance with an excellent economic input / output ratio. Several time-consuming processes are reduced to one pass, thus increasing the precision of seed and fertiliser placement. The gentle tyre packing system ensures optimal seed to soil contact. Not only does the use of the Sprinter result in better efficiency, but in an improved, even seed germination and stronger plants (HORSCH PPF system). Ideal conditions for high yield potential are thereby created.Two models to help you to achieve these aims Sprinter ST: 3 ST: tandem packer (without brake), tyre packer (with brake)4 / 6 ST: only tandem packer (with and without brake)Sprinter 8 / 9 / 12 SW: only tyre packer (with and without brake)Seeding with high precision The multi-row frame of the Sprinter is carried by front wheels / front packer and the tandem tyre packer. The depth control is separate for each frame section. Thus, each section can adjust individually to the ground surface and place the seeds precisely at the set depth. When lifting or lowering the Sprinter, the whole frame is moved to ensure quick u-turns and an even start of operation. All Sprinter ST are equipped with large-capacity seed hoppers up to 5 000 litres. The seed waggon of the Sprinter SW even has a capacity of 8 000 litres of seed and fertiliser for maximum efficiency. The coulters are mounted on durable tines with a trip release system. The trip release system requires more than 200 kg of force in order to set off. This ensures consistent seeding depth – also in problematic soil types and conditions. The coulters place the seeds in bands. A harrow provides even soil coverage (except for 12 SW). Finally each seed band is consolidated with a tyre packer (tractor treaded tyres) to guarantee good seed to soil contact. Your benefits include High efficiency by combining soil preparation and seeding in one pass Good performance (acreage per hour) Flexible handling Excellent levelling qualities Large tine stagger guarantees high trash clearance High coulter pressure (up to 285 kg) ensures precise depth control Optimal seed to soil contact High efficiency due to large-capacity hoppers 3 m to 12 m working width Sprinter 12 SW: Support wheel with intermediate packer Harrow behind the packer (optional for Sprinter SW / ST) Front packer for first levelling and then improved depth control Seed waggon 8000 SW of the Sprinter SW for maximum efficiency Sprinter SW Innovative and robusttine seeding technology Sprinter SW The Sprinter is a robust, compact and multifunctional tine seed drill available in working widths from 3 to 12 m. Due to the Duett coulter it is possible to sow, fertilise and at the same time cultivate the soil effectively as well as produce fine soil in the area where the seed is placed. The Sprinter tines effectively remove harvest residues from the seed horizon. Due to its large-capacity seed hopper the Sprinter is a high hectare output machine. The seed coulters of the Sprinter are arranged in 3 bars (Sprinter 12 SW in 2 bars) with a tine spacing of 25 cm to 32 cm. They prepare the seedbed in an optimal way. As with a cultivator tine the soil is loosened, levelled, mixed and crushed. Your benefits include Universal use: after plough, minimum cultivation and direct sowing Sprinter SW: up to 8 000 l seed or 4 000 l seed + 4 000 l fertiliser Working speeds of 8 – 15 km/h Tines remove harvest residues effectively from the seed horizon High coulter pressure (285 kg) for exact depth control Low horsepower requirement Seeding coulter and tools for mixing, crushing and levelling Specific consolidaton in the germination zone High efficiency of the Sprinter with large hopper for fertiliser and seed Large seed hopper The seed waggon 8000 SW of the Sprinter SW has a capacity of 8 000 litres (partition 50 % seed / 50 % solid or liquid fertiliser). Good manoeuvrability A 2-point pivoting headstock links the compact Sprinter with the tractor. Tractors with wide tyres can make close turns, up to 90°. Any mechanical drives were eliminated. Precise depth control The Sprinter is carried and the seeding depth controlled by two front wheels, the tandem packer* and the tractor.

The powerful set of springs ensures precise coulter setting and therefore seeding depth – even in heavy soil. High quality materials and large pivoting points make grease nipples unnecessary. The seed coulters of the Sprinters are arranged in 3 bars with a tine spacing from 25 cm to 32 cm (depending on the working width). (Sprinter 8 / 9 SW: 3-bar, Sprinter 12 SW: 2-bar).Different coulters are available which can be changed easily. The coulters prepare a perfect seed bed. Like a cultivator they loose, level, mix and crush the soil. The coulters remove stones, rough soil clods and straw residues from the area of seed placement. The seeds are placed with precision and the young plants can grow undisturbed and develop a strong root system.Your benefits include Optimal seed bed preparationPrecise seed placementSimultaneous fertiliser placement with HORSCH PPF system optionalLow maintenance and wearing costs (Sprinter ST and SW) The Duett coulter with dry fertiliser injector in combination with the MultiGrip shank is a combination coulter for simultaneous seed und fertiliser placement which places the seeds in a double row. Sprinter SW Duett coulter with liquid fertiliser pipework Harrow and tandem packerLevelling, covering, consolidationTo ensure proper seed coverage and an even soil / straw distribution above the seed bands, a 2-row harrow follows behind the coulters (for Sprinter 12 SW this is carried out via a disc levelling system). The harrow can be adjusted in height and angle. At last, the tandem tyre packer consolidates the seed band. Sprinter 8 / 9 / 12 SW: only tyre packer (with and without brake). The packing system is aligned in such a way that each tyre follows exactly behind a coulter. Thus, each seed band is consolidated evenly and each seed has optimal soil contact. The tyres have a tractor profile tread and are filled with air. The tractor profile of the tyres and the consistent tensioning of the rubber keep the tyres clean, also under wet conditions. For road transport the packer of the middle segment serves as a chassis. An additional front packer on the Sprinter improves the crumbling and the levelling of the soil and facilitates an exact seed placement.Your benefits include Precise depth controlEven coverage of seedsOptimal seed to soil contact by aligning packing system with coultersSelf cleaning tyre packer 2-row harrow for even distributionof soil and straw Individual depth adjustment with ClipOn spacers Tyre packer (tandem packer) PPF fertiliser coulter – maintenance-free coulter with high coulter pressurePPF systemPPF system – precise and efficient placement of fertiliserPrecise placement of nutrients close to the plantQuick and sustainable fertiliser effectHigh efficiency of fertiliserHigh stability of fertiliserGood plant tolerance also with large fertiliser quantitiesHigh economic viability of fertiliser usageAvailable as an option for Sprinter ST and SW Replaceable coulter point – opens the soil and loosens the area below the seedsFertiliser pipe – to place the fertiliser below the seedsWedge shaped plate – closes the slot and consolidates the soil for 2 – 3 cmPlastic slide shield – soil does not stick to it, even under wet conditionsSeed pipe, seed placement in a double row Sprinter 4 ST with double hopper Micro-granular compound Micro-granular unit for Sprinter 3 / 4 / 6 ST Resilient auger metering device made of stainless steel Easy calibration Electronic control of the metering quantity Direct feed-in into the seed pneumatics For Sprinter 4 and 6 ST application of up to three components is possible (seed, fertiliser and micro-granular compound) NEW COULTER VERSIONS FOR THE Sprinter ST / SW ThinEdge Narrow tine seed coulter, ideal for sowing catch crops directly into the stubbles SingleShot and DoubleShot are possible WideEdge Wide tine seed coulter for an approx. 7 cm wide band sowing SingleShot and DoubleShot are possible ThinEdge coulterWideEdge coulter Additional Features More in download center Media I agree to external content being loaded.

Products Seeding Shank type seeders | Sprinter NT Sprinter NT Flexible and precise The Sprinter NT from 11 to 24 m working width stands for maximum efficiency. The HORSCH NT chisel coulter seed drill allows for a high ratio of fine earth in the seed row and the placement of the seed in a so-called “open furrow”. The seed coulter forms a furrow and removes clods and organic matter from the seed horizon. The seed is placed into this furrow and is fixed by the press wheel in the wet soil. Thus, an excellent emergence is achieved even in extreme climatic conditions. Sowing can be carried out either in cultivated or in uncultivated soil. The machine is optimum for no-till farming. Sprinter 11 NT / Sprinter 12 NT / Sprinter 15 NT The Sprinter 11 NT , 12 NT and 15 NT excel due to a 3-section frame concept that allows for a quick folding when changing fields and makes the machine a compact seed drill for large fields with low horsepower requirement. The Sprinter family guarantees a high clearance between frame and surface as well as between the seed coulters and thus is ideal as a direct seed drill. The individually controlled tine seed coulters place up to 3 components in an individually adjusted seed horizon where organic matter and clods have been removed before.Strong arguments Individually controlled tine seed coulterOptimal seed drill for no-till farmingPerfect for professional large farmsSeed horizon is free from straw and lumpsSowing into the open furrow.

Thus, this machine achieves highest hectare outputs whereas the filling stops are reduced. Ease of maintenance and robustness are another advantage of this technology for large fields. The Sprinter 24 NT is the widest HORSCH seed drill in the market and excels due to its excellent accessibility to all seed coulters and components that have to be maintained. Combined with a HORSCH 21000 SW this machine is the ne plus ultra in the tine seed drill sector for large farms. The HORSCH Seed Wagon 21000 is characterised by its triple tank system that allows for an optimum partition of seed and fertiliser components to achieve utmost efficiency. The easily accessible large platform as well as the large feed openings of the individual tanks reduce setup times and thus additionally increase the productivity of the whole machine. Well-proven components, corrosion-resistant plastic tanks, the very precise calibration of the metering rotors as well as the large hopper capacity complete the simple, clearlyarranged and extremely efficient SW 21000 concept. The optionally available power track with a contact area of 4.2 m² reduces the soil pressure and allows for sowing longer under wet conditions. The long drawbar with the clearly arranged cabinet allows for maximum manoeuvrability despite the size of the machine combination.

They can be adjusted hydraulically and cut into the soil in front of the tine section. Thus, brittle harvest residues and clods are removed from the seed furrow. Another advantage of the cutting discs is the possible, reduced movement of earth due to the cuttings in the disc. Thus, unnecessary additional water losses can be avoided. Sprinter 18 NT with cutting discsSprinter 12 NT with cutting discs Sprinter 15 NT Liquid fertiliser For the Sprinter 15 NT in combination with a seed wagon SW 12000 or SW 12003 a liquid fertiliser version is available as an option. The seed wagon 12000 is equipped with a 6 000 litres hopper, the seed wagon 12003 is equipped with a 4 000 litres hopper made of corrosion-resistant plastic. A clearly arranged control element and a highly visible level indicator at the side of the seed wagon as well as a large toolbox guarantee the wellknown HORSCH user-friendliness that is very much appreciated by the customers. The liquid fertiliser can either be applied via the optional disc section in front of the tines or directly in the tine section.

Products Maestro | Maestro SV 3800 Getting a crop planted at the correct time, at the correct depth, and in the correct environment are the fundamental keys in setting a stage for maximum yield potential. These are the key fundamentals that Maestro row crop planter technology are based on. Technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield. A complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence. This is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting. The Maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials. We use three terms to describe this unit - simple, robust, precise. Conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders. The proven AirVac metering system of the Maestro SV ensures precise population control, superior singulation, and ultra accurate seed spacing. Maestro SV The Maestro SV provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today. With hydraulic downforce, weight transfer, simplistic metering, large capacity, and the lightest footprint in the industry, the Maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise. Watch to learn more! Timing For spring planted crops, no matter where in the world, there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials. If crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility, seed variety, or planter brand but simply because of the calendar. The Maestro SW planter chassis is designed with this in mind. Capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions. Large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time. Pending seedbed conditions, planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window. Seed Placement Precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields, both positive and negative. Placing each seed at a proper depth, into moisture, and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence. This is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials. Shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture. Seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures, experience delayed emergence, and fall behind in yield potential. Precise seed placement is a full system approach in the Maestro SV. To place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar, the weight transfer system on the Maestro SV distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar, thus stabilizing it. With each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce, the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting. Beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth, the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow. Solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle. Advantages Complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day, precision seed placement, along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil structure.Largest seed / fertilizer carrying capacities available in the market today.Up to 249 bushel seed carrying capacity (pending model). Up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity (pending model).Global industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives, weight transfer, and hydraulic downforce technologies. Electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting, individual row shutoff and curve compensation.Chassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprint.Lightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires, large footprint, low tire psi.Light soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows. Weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar, thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth control.More high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the market.ISOBUS implement control allows use of industry or HORSCH virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks. Row Unit Composition The HORSCH Maestro SV utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry, which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance, low maintenance, and low wear characteristics. Several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement. Parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise, consistent, perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener. Indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement. Precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady, and the seed release tried and true. Industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows, along with stabilizing the toolbar. This feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required. This technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down. Also, when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit, a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce. Downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the AutoForce System. The hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies. By creating a smooth ride, singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placement. Capacity The Maestro SV series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day. Its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity (166/249 bushel seed) (725/1225 gallon liquid) contributes to more time planting and less time filling. Available with the Maestro SW Deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity. The Maestro SV planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters. By maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity, Maestro SV secures maximum yield potentials. * Graph is based on a Maestro SW 2430 liquid planter to competitive 24 row 30 inch planters on average factory offered capacities. Comparison is at 7.5 MPH average planting speed with 30 minute fill times. Furrow Integrity Maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential. If soil structure is restrictive, the crop yield is restricted. The Maestro SW uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows. Pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts, especially in wet planting seasons. Eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields. Another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions. Compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in the field.

Products Maestro | Maestro SV 5800 Getting a crop planted at the correct time, at the correct depth, and in the correct environment are the fundamental keys in setting a stage for maximum yield potential. These are the key fundamentals that Maestro row crop planter technology are based on. Technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield. A complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence. This is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting. The Maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials. We use three terms to describe this unit - simple, robust, precise.Conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders.A large diameter tire provides a superior footprint for excellent flotation while virtually eliminating pinch rows. The proven AirVac metering system of the Maestro SV ensures precise population control, superior singulation, and ultra accurate seed spacing. Maestro SV The Maestro SV provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today. With hydraulic downforce, weight transfer, simplistic metering, large capacity, and the lightest footprint in the industry, the Maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise. Watch to learn more! Timing For spring planted crops, no matter where in the world, there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials. If crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility, seed variety, or planter brand but simply because of the calendar. The Maestro SW planter chassis is designed with this in mind. Capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions. Large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time. Pending seedbed conditions, planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window. Seed Placement Precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields, both positive and negative. Placing each seed at a proper depth, into moisture, and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence. This is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials. Shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture. Seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures, experience delayed emergence, and fall behind in yield potential. Precise seed placement is a full system approach in the Maestro SV. To place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar, the weight transfer system on the Maestro SV distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar, thus stabilizing it. With each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce, the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting. Beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth, the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow. Solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle. Advantages Complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day, precision seed placement, along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil structure.Largest seed / fertilizer carrying capacities available in the market today.Up to 249 bushel seed carrying capacity (pending model). Up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity (pending model).Global industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives, weight transfer, and hydraulic downforce technologies. Electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting, individual row shutoff and curve compensation.Chassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprint.Lightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires, large footprint, low tire psi.Light soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows. Weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar, thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth control.More high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the market.ISOBUS implement control allows use of industry or HORSCH virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks. Row Unit Composition The HORSCH Maestro SV utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry, which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance, low maintenance, and low wear characteristics. Several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement. Parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise, consistent, perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener. Indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement. Precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady, and the seed release tried and true. Industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows, along with stabilizing the toolbar. This feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required. This technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down. Also, when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit, a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce. Downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the AutoForce System. The hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies. By creating a smooth ride, singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placement.co Capacity The Maestro SV series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day. Its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity (166/249 bushel seed) (725/1225 gallon liquid) contributes to more time planting and less time filling. Available with the Maestro SW Deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity. The Maestro SV planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters. By maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity, Maestro SV secures maximum yield potentials. * Graph is based on a Maestro SW 2430 liquid planter to competitive 24 row 30 inch planters on average factory offered capacities. Comparison is at 7.5 MPH average planting speed with 30 minute fill times. Furrow Integrity Maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential. If soil structure is restrictive, the crop yield is restricted. The Maestro SW uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows. Pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts, especially in wet planting seasons. Eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields. Another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions. Compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in the field.

Products Maestro | Maestro SV 8800 Getting a crop planted at the correct time, at the correct depth, and in the correct environment are the fundamental keys in setting a stage for maximum yield potential. These are the key fundamentals that Maestro row crop planter technology are based on. Technology and design that maximize every minute of the optimum planting window to secure maximum potential yield. A complete design concept to ensure precise placement of each seed to achieve rapid germination and uniform emergence. This is a platform that protects soil structure integrity during planting. The Maestro row crop planter is the only planter on the market today with a common-sense approach in design that incorporates basic agronomic principals for securing maximum yield potentials. We use three terms to describe this unit - simple, robust, precise.Conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders.A large diameter tire provides a superior footprint for excellent flotation while virtually eliminating pinch rows. The proven AirVac metering system of the Maestro SV ensures precise population control, superior singulation, and ultra accurate seed spacing. Maestro SV The Maestro SV provides the most standard factory installed options of any planter today. With hydraulic downforce, weight transfer, simplistic metering, large capacity, and the lightest footprint in the industry, the Maestro planter will help you plant more acres per day without compromise. Watch to learn more! Timing For spring planted crops, no matter where in the world, there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials. If crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility, seed variety, or planter brand but simply because of the calendar. The Maestro SV planter chassis is designed with this in mind. Capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions. Large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time. Pending seedbed conditions, planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window. Seed Placement Precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields, both positive and negative. Placing each seed at a proper depth, into moisture, and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence. This is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials. Shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture. Seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures, experience delayed emergence, and fall behind in yield potential. Precise seed placement is a full system approach in the Maestro SV. To place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar, the weight transfer system on the Maestro SV distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar, thus stabilizing it. With each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce, the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting. Beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth, the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow. Solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle. Advantages Complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day, precision seed placement, along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil structure.Largest seed / fertilizer carrying capacities available in the market today.Up to 249 bushel seed carrying capacity (pending model). Up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity (pending model).Global industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives, weight transfer, and hydraulic downforce technologies. Electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting, individual row shutoff and curve compensation.Chassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprint.Lightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires, large footprint, low tire psi.Light soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows. Weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar, thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth control.More high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the market.ISOBUS implement control allows use of industry or HORSCH virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks. Row Unit Composition The HORSCH Maestro SV utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry, which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance, low maintenance, and low wear characteristics. Several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement. Parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise, consistent, perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener. Indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement. Precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady, and the seed release tried and true. Industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows, along with stabilizing the toolbar. This feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required. This technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down. Also, when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit, a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce. Downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the AutoForce System. The hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies. By creating a smooth ride, singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placement.co Capacity The Maestro SV series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day. Its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity (166/249 bushel seed) (725/1225 gallon liquid) contributes to more time planting and less time filling. Available with the Maestro SW Deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity. The Maestro SV planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters. By maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity, Maestro SV secures maximum yield potentials. * Graph is based on a Maestro SW 2430 liquid planter to competitive 24 row 30 inch planters on average factory offered capacities. Comparison is at 7.5 MPH average planting speed with 30 minute fill times. Furrow Integrity Maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential. If soil structure is restrictive, the crop yield is restricted. The Maestro SW uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows. Pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts, especially in wet planting seasons. Eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields. Another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions. Compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in the field.

Our industry leading seed and fertilizer capacities maximize your planting window, our legendary chassis systems with pioneering weight transfer technology aid to eliminate yield robbing pinch rows plus provide a stable toolbar for row unit downforce, and our globally proven row unit design can now come factory equipped with Precision Planting technology including the Gen III 2020 monitor, vSet meters with vDrive, Delta Force, Wave Vision, Speed Tube and Clean Sweep. The ultimate planter platform with capacity for maximizing planted acres per day, maintaining seedbed and furrow integrity, while having a complete systems approach to pin-point seed placement…now configured with Precision Planting technology is ready for you to take planting to the next level. Timing For spring planted crops, no matter where in the world, there is a 10-14 day planting window of opportunity to secure maximum yield potentials. If crop is planted after that optimum window yield losses will result not because of fertility, seed variety, or planter brand but simply because of the calendar. The Maestro SP planter chassis is designed with this in mind. Capacity is key in securing more planted acres per day especially when in variable field conditions. Large seed and liquid fertilizer carrying capacities allow for more planting time and less filling time. Pending seedbed conditions, planting speed can be increased beyond normal speeds to capitalize further on more planted acres per day within the optimum window. Seed Placement Precise seed depth placement has significant impact on yields, both positive and negative. Placing each seed at a proper depth, into moisture, and properly closing the furrow promotes rapid germination along with uniform emergence. This is a fundamental key in setting the stage for maximum yield potentials. Shallow placed seed often has higher mortality or delayed emergence due to lack of moisture. Seed placed too deep can become victim to cold soil temperatures, experience delayed emergence, and fall behind in yield potential. Precise seed placement is a full system approach in the Maestro SP. To place a seed precisely first starts with stabilizing the toolbar, the weight transfer system on the Maestro SP distributes the chassis weight over the width of the toolbar, thus stabilizing it. With each row unit featuring standard hydraulic downforce, the row unit can be engaged into the soil with up to 770 pounds of downforce without worry of the toolbar lifting. Beyond keeping the row unit secured at desired depth, the disc opener of the row unit must be kept consistently and at a perpendicular angle to maintain a proper seed furrow. Solid parallel arm shaft design on front of the row unit ensures the row unit maintains a consistent perpendicular engagement angle. Furrow Integrity Maintaining uniform soil structure at planting time gives each seed equal chance to reach maximum yield potential. If soil structure is restrictive, the crop yield is restricted. The Maestro SP uses large tires with a light soil footprint along with the weight transfer system to minimize compaction on headlands and aid in eliminating pinch rows. Pinch row compaction can have significant yield impacts, especially in wet planting seasons. Eliminating this compacted zone secures your maximum potential yields. Another advantage with the large tires is maneuverability in variable soil conditions. Compaction will be significantly reduced while maneuvering in the field. Advantages Complete concept for maximizing planted acres per day, precision seed placement, along with maintaining uniform and consistent seedbed soil structure.Largest seed / fertilizer carrying capacities available in the market today.Up to 249 bushel seed carrying capacity (pending model). Up to 1225 gallons of liquid fertilizer capacity (pending model).Global industry first and leading technology in electric meter drives, weight transfer, and hydraulic downforce technologies. Electric drive meters precisely singulate seed while having the ability for variable rate planting, individual row shutoff and curve compensation.Chassis system designed for large product carrying capacity while having a light footprint.Lightest soil footprint in the industry – large diameter tires, large footprint, low tire psi.Light soil footprint in combination with weight transfer system aids in elimination of yield robbing pinch rows. Weight transfer system stabilizes the toolbar, thus resulting in superior stabilization of row units for precise depth control.More high performance features as standard equipment than any other planter on the market.ISOBUS implement control allows use of industry or HORSCH virtual terminals for planter operation and precision farming tasks. Conversion between 15 and 30 inch row spacing on splitter models is easily accomplished via hydraulic cylinders. Row Unit Composition The HORSCH Maestro SP utilizes the strongest built row unit in the industry, which has been proven globally for superior agronomic performance, low maintenance, and low wear characteristics. Several key design parameters ensure long life of the row unit along with precision placement. Parallelogram design integrity is absolutely necessary for precise, consistent, perpendicular engagement of the double disc opener. Indexed depth setting which eliminates the need to “calibrate” each row for depth and ensures precise seed placement. Precision machined row bodies with hydraulic downforce result in consistent singulation and ride quality keeping the meter steady, and the seed release tried and true. Industry first and industry leading frame weight distribution system aids in eliminating pinch rows, along with stabilizing the toolbar. This feature ensures the toolbar stays parallel to the seedbed no matter the row unit downforce required. This technology eliminates additional weight needed on the wings to hold wings down. Also, when using hydraulic downforce on the row unit, a stable and firm positioned toolbar is needed to apply downforce. Downforce can be adjusted in-cab or automatically on-the-fly through the AutoForce System. The hydraulics eliminate the chatter and bounce to the row unit caused by other downforce systems with springs or other competitive technologies. By creating a smooth ride, singulation integrity is preserved and the row unit maintains downforce and precise soil engagement for consistent seed depth placement. Capacity The Maestro SP series is a complete high-efficiency planting concept built from the ground up for capacity and increased planted acres per day. Its industry leading seed and liquid fertilizer capacity (166/249 bushel seed) (725/1225 gallon liquid) contributes to more time planting and less time filling. Available with the Maestro SP Deluxe is an additional saddle tank option supplying an additional 500 gallons of liquid capacity. The Maestro SP planter has been a globally proven concept to achieve more planted acres per day than same or larger size competitive planters. By maximizing planted acres per day and the planting window of opportunity, Maestro SP secures maximum yield potentials. * Graph is based on a Maestro SP planter to competitive 24 row 30 inch planters on average factory offered capacities. Comparison is at 7.5 MPH average planting speed with 30 minute fill times. Precision Planting 20|20 monitor - You cannot change what you cannot see. Let the 20|20 system lead you to better decisions as it monitors, controls, and diagnoses your field conditions and equipment performance in real-time.vSet - Traditional seed meters need continual adjustment to plant accurately which leads to skips, doubles, and ultimately, lost yield. vSet seed meters singulate seeds accurately without any adjustments resulting in perfect seed placement throughout your field.vDrive - Mechanical drive systems require costly and time-consuming maintenance. vDrive is a maintenance-free electric drive system that lets you breeze through planting without the headaches of a mechanical drive system.DeltaForce - Running a single downforce setting across an entire field causes yield loss because the setting is rarely correct. DeltaForce is an automated row by row downforce control system that measures and adjusts downforce every time there is variability in your field, so your crops will thrive for optimal yields.WaveVision - Traditional seed sensors count dust and seed, giving you inaccurate population counts and that uneasy feeling of not knowing if you can believe your planter monitor. WaveVision is a seed sensor that counts only seeds and not dust, giving you confidence that the population you see on your monitor is the population that you’re planting.SpeedTube - Most planting seasons have weather challenges that make it difficult to plant all your fields in ideal conditions. SpeedTube is a seed delivery system that allows you to double your planting speed without sacrificing performance. You’ll have a sense of accomplishment when the rain comes and your planter is already back in the shed.SpeedTube CloseupCleanSweep - Setting row cleaners correctly is time-consuming and frustrating.

Products | AutoForce AutoForceautomatic coulter pressure controlAutoForce – What do you need an automatic coulter pressure control for?Stony soils require more coulter pressure to place the seed at a consistent depth. If the coulter pressure is too low the coulter body would not move smoothly and the seed would germinate irregularly and with different speed.Light conditions or pressure-sensitive soils need less coulter pressure so that the soil is not compacted. Too much coulter pressure compacts the soil and slows down the development of the roots although all seed was placed at the same depth.There rarely are fields that are completely even. The coulter pressure has to be adapted to each section of the field.This is why HORSCH developed an automatic coulter pressure control system.How does AutoForce work on the soil?The contact pressure of the row is measured with a sensor at the two support wheels. This pressure (= nominal value) is previously set in the terminal. You can choose between three pressure levels 25 kg – 50 kg and 80 kg (the values can also be adapted individually).With changing soil conditions, the row needs more or less power to be able to keep up the set placement depth. The contact pressure would change. The sensor detects this, and the system regulates the contact pressure in such a way that it always corresponds to the nominal value that has been set. This is possible due to the design of the machine which allows for transferring weight to the seed bar.The coulter pressure automatically varies between 150 kg and 350 kg. Thus, the grain is always embedded at the same level. A too shallow placement as well as soil compaction can thus be avoided. AutoForce pressure sensor: Weight recording is carried out via Piezo (pressure sensor) technology. Details of the Piezo sensor HORSCH is a leading global manufacturer of innovative agricultural technology and modern solutions for soil cultivation, seeding and plant protection.

Products Sprayers | Leeb VL Sprayer Leeb VL:Well-known precision combined with flexibilityTo achieve more in a shorter time with less machines – due to this strategy companies today manage to work successfully and to remain competitive. As a manufacturer of plant production technology it is our objective to support the farmers with efficient and precise technology. Our engineers work hard to find the appropriate solutions for the special requirements on application technology in the plant protection sector and to design an efficient and flexible sprayer for a wide range of use. With the Leeb VL we respond to the requirements “more clearance” and “flexible track”. Depending on vegetation and season the sprayer can flexibly adapt to the operational conditions and the challenges to provide our customers and their crops with utmost efficiency. There are many equipment versions for Leeb VL that make sure that it can perfectly adapt to any task.Flexible track – flexible heightClearance of up to 6.5 ft and a track width of up to 13.1 ftUp to 29.5 in wide tires are possibleOptional: hydraulic height and width adjustmentAnti-slip control for optimum tractionExcellent manoeuvrabilityExcellent manoeuvrability due to standard all-wheel steeringThe central tube frame allows for a turning radius of only 11.4 ftHigh-performance chassisThe pneumatically spring-loaded chassis guarantees a stable road and field handling at high speeds.ComfortDriveFlex chassisThe front cabin on the central tube frame and the boom in parallelogramm suspension guarantee an optimum weight distribution – on the road and in the field.The arrangement allows for enough space for a tank capacity of up to 2113 gal and a constantly high driving stability with an optimum weight distribution of 50 : 50.Each wheel of the standard chassis ComfortDriveFlex is individually suspended at the slide frame. The result is an excellent driving comfort.The pneumatic individual wheel suspension adapts to the ground. The result is an extremely comfortable driving experience, and the boom control system is supported positively.Due to the smooth driving characteristics, the boom control system easily manages to keep the balance even at higher speeds.The flexible clearance of up to 6.5 ft (depending on the tires) allows for protecting the plants while working even in high populations.Automotive drive controlAutomotive drive control with standard equipment: Maximum load controlOverspeed controlDriving with reduced motor speedSpeed controlHeadland managementThe driving strategy can either be determined with the accelerator pedal or with the control lever.

With the agrirouter you can manage this in an uncomplicated and safe way. And what is most important: you keep complete control of your data.The DKE GmbH (Daten (data), Kommunikation (communication), Entwicklung (development)) is a consortium of different companies from the agricultural sector which HORSCH is involved in, too. The objective of this association is the development of an interface for data to transfer digital information wirelessly to the different associated parties.

Products Intelligence | Terminals & Operational Concepts Terminals & Operational Concepts HORSCH Terminal Touch 1200 TerminalTerminal Touch 800 ISOBUS operational concepts After long years of experience in the crop care sector the intuitive handling concept of the HORSCH Leeb technology has been optimised, extended and is now successively introduced in the seed drill sector. The innovative handling concept facilitates the adjustment, handling and monitoring of the machine for the farmer. To meet the individual requirements of the machine operators on handling, the terminal interface can be configured freely. By means of the software a fully diagnoseable platform was created that can control an almost unlimited number of sections and components. TaskController The ISOBUS TaskController allows for easily transferring data from the PC to the terminal. It also is possible to transfer and document seed rates, sown hectares and other data that were recorded while sowing from the terminal to the PC. This facilitates the administration of the acreage index. Orders can be created and worked off via the integrated order handling management. Advantages of the TaskController Uncomplicated data exchange Automatic documentation Structured working due to data management Simple administration of the acreage index Simple accounting and proof for contract services VariableRate ISOBUS VariableRate allows for a site-specific application of seed and fertiliser. Thus, with an appropriate application card for every section within a field the optimum quantity of fertiliser and seed can be applied. Advantages of VariableRate Saving of seed and fertiliser as only the necessary quantity is applied Homogeneous emergence with an optimum number of grains/m² Simple and quick documentation– The different application rates are documented automatically.– Uncomplicated transmission to the acreage index Reduced stress for the driver– Fields are drilled or fertilised automatically with the optimum application rate Protection of the environment– Only the necessary amount of fertiliser is applied. SectionControl The ISOBUS SectionControl function allows for an automatic half-width control. Via GPS the current position is identified. Thus, at field boundaries, on the headlands, in case of overlaps or in defined areas sections (half-widths) or the whole working widths are switched off automatically. When using a HORSCH Touch 800 / 1200 Terminal you can additionally use the MultiControl function. It automatically switches the application of fertiliser and seed on and off independently. Without MultiControl either fertiliser or seed can be switched on and off at the right time. Advantages of SectionControl Saving of seed and fertiliser as overlaps on the headlands and at the field boundaries are reduced to a minimum Constant working quality on the whole field Productivity increase under various conditions (day and night, fog) Reduced stress for the driver Protection of the environment MultiControl When using a HORSCH Touch 800 / 1200 Terminal you can also use the MultiControl function. If SectionControl is activated, MultiControl allows for switching on and off seed and fertiliser independently. If sowing is carried out in a site-specific way with VariableRate, MultiControl varies the quantity of fertiliser and seed independently. Without MultiControl, SectionControl allows for either switching on and off either seed or fertiliser at the right time respectively VariableRate allows for varying either seed or fertiliser.

Products | Tillage The soil tillage solutions from HORSCH help you to achieve your individual requirements and goals in arable farming in the best possible way, just as with the Seeding Technology. During the 30-year-old company tradition HORSCH – like no other manufacturer – contributed to the breakthrough of tillage without a plough. In 2013, these efforts were awarded with the “Milestone of Agricultural Engineering“ award. A lot of products, e.g. the Terrano, and Joker models and last but not least the universal seed drill Pronto DC, allow for farming without a plough on the highest level. According to the Federal Statistical Office by now 40 per cent of the arable land is cultivated without a plough. For wheat it amounts to even 60 per cent. 20 years ago no-one dared to believe that. HORSCH played an important part in getting this far. With this background other milestones in agricultural engineering will be developed.The agricultural origin makes HORSCH and its products in cultivation tillage and planting operations your optimal solution. All machines can be perfectly adapted to your requirements (soil, climate, company sizes...).The following product groups are available for the North American market: Disc harrows Joker RX Joker MT Joker HD Cultivators Omnis FT Terrano FX Terrano GX Tiger MT HORSCH is a leading global manufacturer of innovative agricultural technology and modern solutions for soil cultivation, seeding and plant protection.

Service | Testimonials Brent Hager, Rugby, North Dakota Hooked on HORSCH Brent Hager Located near Rugby, North Dakota, Brent Hager grows corn and soybeans with his father and two employees. Hager is the proud owner of a Panther 6015 (the model number of this product has since changed to the Panther 460), Maestro 2430 and Joker PT400. You could say he became hooked on HORSCH in 2012, when he purchased his first piece of HORSCH equipment, and has been adding to his fleet ever since. His first experience with HORSCH, however, happened in 2011 on a side job, when he was custom spraying for another farmer.""I was spraying some wheat ground that was custom seeded with a HORSCH drill, and it caught my eye,"" said Hager. ""A few days later I was spraying next to another field seeded by a HORSCH. It was a wet spring, and there was just perfect emergence out of that drill.""The timing worked well because Hager was in the market for something new. ""Our old drill was starting to get used up,"" said Hager. ""After looking at those fields, I knew I had to start looking at the Panther seriously. I owned one the next spring."" In his first year of owning the Panther, Hager used it to drill wheat, soybeans and corn, before he later adopted a pure corn/soybean rotation. He couldn't have asked for better results. ""Our wheat stand was perfect. We drilled beans in 30-inch paired rows, and they were some of the best we'd ever grown. They consistently yield 2-3 bushels more than our 30-inch rows. The corn we planted with the Panther was very successful, too,"" he said.The Panther also works extremely well in Hager's wet conditions. ""I can get back in the field one to two days sooner after a big rain event compared to competitor drills,"" he said. ""I attribute that to the wide tire press wheels that shed mud and have a light footprint. Having no disks or gauge wheels to plug is also a huge plus.""In 2013 he expanded his HORSCH lineup with the Joker PT400, which he uses on his corn stalks in the fall to manage the tough residue. He also runs it over his sloughs to help dry out the wet ground. Hager said, ""I used to be strictly no-till, but we just can't do it anymore with our wet springs. It does a beautiful job and rarely plugs. It leaves a great seed bed in the spring.""The following season he added one more piece of HORSCH equipment with the Maestro. ""Seed cost and harvest ability were the main factors in going with a conventional planter instead of my air seeder for corn,"" he said.In addition to using the planter for corn, he also plants some soybean acres on triangular shaped fields, where the Maestro's individual section control eliminates double planting. ""I've owned almost every other type of planter before, and this one by far has been the superior planter,"" said Hager. ""In my opinion it's the only planter on the market.""Along the way, Hager has received a lot of help from his dealer, Butler Machinery in Devils Lake, North Dakota. ""Butler has been very good to work with,"" he said. They always have parts on hand, and their service department is second to none.""Hager also gives a lot of credit to the people at HORSCH. ""Jesse (territory manager) and Trent (product specialist) have been a hugepart of my success,"" he said. ""HORSCH has a great productline, but when you have two guys like that along with a great dealer, it gives you a lot of confidence going into a new product."" Bill Darrington, Persia, IA Iowa Farmer adds Joker to Tackle Tough Terrain Bill Darrington Persia, Iowa — When it comes to residue management, the job of a corn-on-corn farmer is tougher than most. It’s even harder for farmers like Bill Darrington, who are at odds with managing their heavy residue while trying to conserve moisture and prevent erosion as much as possible. This spring, however, Darrington decided to stack the deck more in his favor with a new HORSCH Joker RT330.Since he’s based in Persia, Iowa, many might assume Darrington is blessed with ideal corn growing conditions, but that isn’t necessarily the case. “We don’t have typical Iowa weather,” he says. “Our weather patterns are more similar to Nebraska. We’re likely to dry out every July and August, so we aren’t allowed the luxuries of people with frequent rains.”The contour is equally challenging. “We don’t have rolling hills — we’re rolling things over,” jokes Darrington, alluding to the fact that 20-percent slopes in his fields are common. Additionally, the soil types on Darrington’s farm vary as greatly as the terrain, from light soils on windblown hilltops to sticky gumbo in the Missouri River beds.Previously, Darrington owned a couple of disks that he used for tillage. Although these tools aren’t designed for water conservation or erosion control, he limited their use to one pass in the fall, trying to keep the negative effects of disking to a minimum. He wasn’t necessarily pleased with the performance of the disks,though. They blended residue inconsistently and produced a rough field finish, preventing him from achieving ideal seed placement at planting time.To better suit his needs, Darrington wanted to switch to strip till methods. He felt this would allow him to prevent moisture loss and erosion, while giving him a clean seedbed, free of root balls, for planting. However, the slopes thwarted his hopes, since it is virtually impossible for him to maintain straight lines across such steep hillsides. But rather than reverting back to the disks, Darrington devised another strategy to achieve the desired results. “I wanted a shallow tillage tool that pinned residue close to the ground, so that the trash sweeps on my planter could efficiently move the residue to the side,” he says.Working closely with Sorensen Equipment, his trusted dealer from Harlan, Iowa, Darrington determined that a Joker could be a good fit for him. The Joker has two rows of 20-inch-diameter notched discs that are angled for aggressive residue chopping and incorporation at working depths between one and five inches. It also includes the Roll-Flex finishing tool, which consolidates the tilled surface to prevent moisture loss, reduce erosion concerns, and produce a smooth, consistent seedbed for planting. These benefits make the unit better suited for Darrington’s dry, hilly farmland than the tools he was using.So, Darrington requested a demo and successfully tested the unit on his toughest soils — the river bed gumbo. Although the Joker seemed to excel during the demo, Darrington wasn’t quite ready to pull the trigger. “Ultimately, planting is the most important activity a farmer does,” he says, “so I didn’t purchase a Joker until I had a chance to plant behind it.” However, everything worked exactly as hoped. The Joker chopped the corn residue and consolidated it in the top couple inches of soil so that the planter’s pneumatic trash wheels, running at 20 psi down pressure, could effectively sweep the root balls to the side, away from where the seed was placed. Even Darrington’s friend, who had many years of experience farming the river bed, was impressed at the Joker’s performance. “He said there was no way the Joker would work in the gumbo, but it did,” Darrington says.After receiving delivery of his own 33-foot Joker RT330 in May 2015, Darrington immediately put it to work, breaking one of his personal rules of tillage. “I don’t like spring tillage because we get that much more erosion,” he says.Nonetheless, his crew hit the ground running with the Joker, operating it up to 13 miles per hour and covering as much as 1,100 acres in just three days. “It’s amazing how many acres you can run over at 13 miles per hour,” says Darrington, who is used to his old disks operating at only five miles per hour. “One person with the Joker can get more done than two people with two disks. That’s a great benefit, since good, experienced farm labor is hard to find.”Along with its speed in the field, the Joker also proved to offer quick maintenance. “You can grease this tool in just a few minutes,” says Darrington. “Every aspect of the Joker is efficient.”Additionally, some of the fields he covered this year were especially tough, due to challenging spring weather in his area. In fact, some of the Missouri river beds had overgrown with weeds, including water hemp as high as five feet. Nonetheless, one pass with the Joker through the wet ground was able to knock it down well enough for Darrington to successfully plant into it. ""No other tillage tool could have done it,“ he says.Going forward, Darrington hopes he can revert back to his tillage routine, doing just one pass with the Joker in the fall. He’s also excited to continue improving the condition of his seedbeds, so that the soybeans, which make up a small portion of his operation, can be harvested more efficiently with flex headers. “The Joker leaves a very smooth, level surface,” says Darrington. “You can immediately feel the difference, and in the next two years, we hope to get our fields more level than they’ve ever been before.”Additionally, Darrington stands by his decision to use the Joker instead of following the vertical tillage trend. “I find the vertical tillage movement confusing,” he says. “The residue just lays there, and when the wind blows, you’ve got ditches full of corn stalks.”Not to mention, he feels that the lines are a bit blurred between traditional disk sand vertical tillage. “If you can’t tell if it’s vertical tillage or a disk, it’s a disk,” he says. Despite other trends in tillage, Darrington feels confident in the new tillage concept that his Joker RT330 offers. “Disks look the same as they did 30 years ago,” he says. “But the Joker is a new generation of tillage.” I agree to external content being loaded.

Company | Demo Garden HORSCH demogarden The demo garden is situated on the premises of Gut Sitzenhof adjacent to the FITcentre and the factory premises of the HORSCH Maschinen GmbH. It comprises demonstrative experiments as well as special tests with regard to various questions and problems. The test fields were established in 1997 and, since then, have been used to exchange experiences with farmers and to answer agricultural questions.The fields are divided into a 13.5 hectare demonstration area and a 6.5 hectare trial plot. Up to 300 plots (3 m wide, 50 m long) can be established in this generous demo garden. In the front fields a long-term test concerning cultivation intensity has been put in place. This test has been running since the establishment of the demo garden and covers all sectors from intensive tillage with plough or deep cultivation over minimum tillage to direct seeding.The remaining plots are used to try and explain various questions regarding cultivation and sowing.SoilThe rock material present at the site Sitzenhof is shell limestone which was formed from fossil calcareous deposits approx. 243 to 235 million years ago. The soil type is brown earth that resulted from a browning and a simultaneous enrichment with humus of the top soil in a humid climate. The soil texture is sandy loam with a clay content of 25 per cent.A specific characteristic of the site are the changing soil conditions with soil points ranging between 28 and 42 and the high ratio of stones.In this region, traditional farming with commercial crops as well as livestock farming is prominent. The agricultural fields in the region and at the site Sitzenhof are used for the cultivation of cereals and rape that are marketed traditionally and for the cultivation of cereals, grain maize and maize for silage for the use in livestock farming and for energy production in biogas plants.ClimateThe demo garden is situated in the warm temperate rain zone of the medium latitudes, in the transition zone from the Western European maritime climate to the Eastern European continental climate with a slight tendency towards the continental one that is marked by colder winters and hotter summers with less humidity.This tendency is supported by the average annual temperature of 7.5°C which is 0.9°C lower than the German annual average. With a medium annual rainfall of about 670 mm in the observation period, Gut Sitzenhof is slightly below the German annual average. During the past five years rainfall has settled down clearly above 700 mm per year.Long-term testThe long-term test “cultivation intensity“ that was put in place in 1997 first and foremost serves to observe the annual effects of different cultivation types. The resulting findings are used to evaluate the different initial situations for cultivation.The test results can be summarised as follows:Cultivation intensity depends on several factors. The main factors are the type of crop, the condition of the soil before cultivation (compaction, tracks) and the moisture at the time of cultivation.The results show the tendency that, in many years, deep loosening brings about yield benefitsThe maximum loosening depth depends on the thickness of the topsoil (at the site Sitzenhof max. up to 20 cm, then it gives way to the subsoil); on deeper sites loosening at a depth of 35 – 40 cm can be reasonable; on shallow, stony sites the maximum loosening depth often is limited to 10 to 15 cm.Loosening depth cannot be generalised, but has to be adapted specifically for every site, every crop and the humidity of the soil.Basically a certain degree of cultivation guarantees a good yield; at the site Sitzenhof direct seeding results in lower yields, especially for winter rape.Possible savings in cultivation start with consequently avoiding compactions and tracks.Underground fertilisation compared to wide spread fertilisation considerably supports the young population in difficult years and, thus, can have important advantages for the population development, e.g. under the extremely wet conditions of the autumn sowing of winter rape in 2010.Also from the economical point of view cultivation intensity is an important parameter to optimise unit costs. But also from this point of view only yields at a constantly high level guarantee good farm profits.Since 2003 the experiences with regard to cultivation at the site Sitzenhof have been completed by an extremely heavy site in the Czech Republic (East of Prague). This second site will be presented on the occasion of the practical field days 2011 and the experiences we made there will be discussed.

Company | Foundation The HORSCH Foundation National projectsIn Germany, too, the HORSCH Foundation supports numerous projects, e.g. at community level, but also with regard to the co-operation with universities and the support of students. HORSCH attaches major importance to a commitment on site at the sites in Schwandorf, Ronneburg and Landau. For example by the initiative Integration SAD which is closely connected to the HORSCH Foundation. The initiative was founded in 2015, the year after the big refugee movements, and its objective is to support refugees with regard to integration and access to the labour market in the district of Schwandorf. Therefore, the initiative initiates, plans and accompanies projects and supports voluntary commitment. A special focus is on the integration of women which are provided with special leisure time and learning facilities. Thus, more than 100 mothers have already taken part in German language courses in different towns in the district of Schwandorf. They were supported by 30 consultants as well as by more than 100 volunteers.The Foundation is also involved in Landau and Ronneburg: in Landau it mainly supports already existing projects. In Ronneburg it creates new projects which on the one hand serve the social interaction and on the other hand open learning spaces for topics like nature, sustainability and environment.For these and a lot of other projects we consider it as a privilege to take on social responsibility in co-operation with a lot of committed people and thus to be able to contribute to healthy human beings and a healthy environment beyond our company.

General1.1. Our supplies, services and offers are based exclusively on these terms. Any deviations from these terms are to be in writing. We will not recognize any terms of the customer which conflict with, or deviate from our terms unless these have been explicitly accepted by us in writing. Our terms will also apply when we deliver goods to the customer unconditionally even though we are aware of terms of the customer which conflict with, or deviate from our own terms of business. The version of our terms applicable at the time will also apply to all future business relations.1.2. The customer will not be entitled to assign claims against us.1.3. h Agreements, contractually specified uses, acceptance of procurement risks, warranties, or any other assurances prior to, or upon conclusion of the contract, shall be effective only when same are in writing.1.4. Our offers shall be non-binding until the order is confirmed in writing. Goods shall be subject to prior sale.2. Offer, scope of supply or service, delivery period, transfer of risk and return deliveries2.1. Our written order confirmation shall be definitive as far as the scope of supply or service is concerned. Same shall apply to any offer made by us provided the offer is accepted and no confirmation has been received.2.2. Documents such as cost estimates, drawings, diagrams, dimensions, weights, or any other performance data shall be deemed to be binding only when same are explicitly agreed upon in writing. We reserve the ownership rights and copyright in respect of cost estimates, drawings, plans and other documents (e.g., also in the case of tender invitations). The aforementioned documents are not to be made accessible to third parties without obtaining our prior written consent. Said documents must be returned to us immediately upon request should we not receive the order.2.3. We reserve the right to make alterations for technical reasons in terms of manufacturing, as well as to deviate from dimensions, weights, colours, samples etc., provided same are deemed reasonable as far as the customer is concerned. This applies, in particular, to alterations and/or deviations which contribute towards maintaining or increasing the value of the goods. The same shall also apply analogously to subsequent deliveries.2.4. Delivery periods and dates shall be deemed to be agreed as approximate unless we explicitly provide legally-binding written confirmation thereof. The delivery period shall begin upon dispatch of the order confirmation, however, not before the customer has provided the required details, documents and permits and the agreed down payment has been received. Should these prerequisites not be fulfilled, the delivery period shall be extended appropriately. The supplier’s adherence to the delivery period shall be dependent upon the customer fulfilling his/her contractual obligations.The delivery period shall also deemed to have been adhered to when the article of sale has been dispatched, at the latest, on the 14th calendar day after the delivery date or readiness for dispatch has been notified.2.5. The delivery period shall be appropriately extended where action is necessary within the framework of labour disputes, as well as in the case of unforeseen obstacles over which we have no control (e.g., shortages of materials, energy and manpower, as well as insufficient transportation capacity, production disturbances, traffic disruptions, official orders, etc.) insofar as it is established that such obstacles have a decisive effect upon the production or delivery of the article of sale. Same shall also apply to subcontractors and subsuppliers in the same situation. We shall also not accept responsibility for the above-described circumstances if they occur during an already prevailing delay in performance, provided such delay was not intentional or due to gross negligence on our part. In important cases, we shall inform the customer as soon as possible of the occurrence and cessation of any such obstacles.2.6. In case of delayed deliveries, the customer shall be able to withdraw from the contract only upon the abortive expiry of a reasonable period of grace specified by the customer in writing (unless the setting of a time limit is not required by law) and when notification that the goods are ready for dispatch has not been given by that time. Same shall also apply in the case of a partial delay or partial impossibility. The consequences of the delayed delivery or impossibility of performance shall be determined according to clause 6.2.7. Should the goods or object of performance not be collected by the customer by the agreed date, should dispatch be postponed at the request of the customer, or should the customer fail to collect the goods or object of performance after having received notification of readiness including a reminder, the customer shall be charged the costs incurred for storage and financing, beginning from expiry of the agreed date, notification of readiness, or receipt of the reminder, at a rate of at least 0.5% (up to a maximum total of 5%) of the relevant invoice amount for each month or part thereof that collection is delayed, unless the customer can provide evidence of lower costs.We shall, however, be entitled, after the setting and abortive expiry of a reasonable time limit, to dispose of the article of sale in another way and to supply the customer with another article of sale within a reasonable extended period of time.The aforementioned conditions shall apply analogously to any agreed additional or subsequent orders which lead to a delay in delivery of the goods. 2.8. Should the customer fail to take delivery of the article of sale or object of performance after two reasonable time limits have been set, we shall be entitled to charge a cancellation fee of 15 % of the invoice amount.2.9. Risk shall be transferred to the customer upon collection/dispatch of the article of sale - also by means of own vehicles - including in the case of free delivery.2.10. Delivered articles are to be taken delivery of by the customer, even if such articles have insignificant defects, without prejudice to the customer’s rights as specified in clause 5.2.11. Should dispatch be delayed due to circumstances for which the customer is responsible, risk shall be transferred to the customer from the date of notification of readiness for dispatch, however, we shall be obliged to arrange insurance at the request and expense of the customer.3. Prices and terms of payment3.1. In the absence of a special agreement, the prices shall apply ex works/store, excluding loading and packaging. The legally applicable VAT rate must be added to the prices.3.2. In the absence of a special agreement, our invoices within Germany shall be payable within 30 days from the date of the invoice. Upon payment within 10 days of the invoice date, we shall grant a cash discount of 2%. In special cases, we reserve the right to collect invoice amounts per cash on delivery, or to insist on payment prior to delivery.In the case of deliveries outside Germany, payment prior to delivery shall apply as a matter of principle insofar as no deviating terms of payment have been agreed in writing. As far as all payments are concerned, the date of payment shall be deemed to be the date on which we can dispose of the money or on which the bank confirms to us that payment has been received.3.3. Should, during the period of time between conclusion of the contract and the delivery date, a factor which is decisive in terms of pricing, such as labour and/or energy costs and/or the costs of raw materials and/or process materials, increase, we shall be entitled to adjust the prices by the amount which the procurement or manufacturing costs of the article of sale have increased. Should the price increase exceed 10% of the originally agreed price, the customer shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract. 3.4. Any agreed discounts, rebates or other reductions shall be dependent upon proper fulfilment of all provisional or partially non-fulfilled agreements between the customer and our company at the time the contract is concluded.3.5. Cheques and bills of exchange shall only be accepted upon prior agreement and on account of payment. Charges shall always be borne by the customer and payable immediately.3.6. Our representatives and other employees are not entitled to accept payments without written authority to collect or to accept any obligations on our behalf.3.7. The withholding of payments or setting off against counter-claims of the customer shall not be permitted except as provided for in clause 3.8., unless it has been established that the counter-claims are undisputed or are res judicata.3.8. In the case of justified and accepted notices of defects, the customer shall be entitled to withhold payments in reasonable proportion to the defects. Should a notice of defect not be justified and not be accepted by us, we shall be entitled to demand compensation from the customer for any expenditure incurred.3.9. In case of delay, we shall be entitled to charge the legal rate of interest. The right to submit a further claim for damages is reserved in case of delay.In case of delay, all other claims vis-à-vis the customer arising from deliveries or services shall be payable immediately irrespective of any agreed/deferred payment dates.4. Reservation of ownership4.1. We shall reserve ownership of the article of sale (conditional commodity) until payment in full has been effected.We shall also reserve ownership until all claims to which we are entitled vis-à-vis the customer on whatever legal grounds at the time the contract is concluded and in the future which ensue from the business relationship, including any refinancing or acceptor’s bills relating to the goods delivered, are satisfied.Payments made against a customer’s promissory note issued by us shall only be deemed to be payment when the bill of exchange has been redeemed by the drawee and we are thus released from liability for the bill of exchange.The inclusion of individual claims in a current account, as well as drawing up a balance and its acceptance, shall not affect our right of ownership.4.2. The treatment and processing of the conditional commodity shall be effected for us as the manufacturer in terms of Section 950 of the German Civil Code without any liability on our part. The treated and processed article shall be deemed to be a conditional commodity in terms of clause 4.1. Should the customer process, combine and mix the conditional commodity with other articles which do not belong to us, we shall be entitled to co-ownership of the new article in proportion to the invoice value of the conditional commodity in relation to the invoice value of the other goods used.Should our ownership extinguish as a result of combination or mixing, the customer shall even now transfer to us his/her right of ownership to the new stock and the object to the extent of the invoice value of the conditional commodity and shall keep same in safe custody for us free of charge.Our co-ownership rights shall be deemed to be a conditional commodity in terms of clause 4.1.4.3. The customer may only sell the conditional commodity in the normal course of business subject to customary commercial terms and conditions provided he/she is not in delay and provided the accounts receivable from the resale are transferred to us in accordance with clauses 4.4 to 4.6. The customer shall not be entitled to dispose of the conditional commodity in any other way. 4.4. Claims deriving from the resale of the conditional commodity will even now be assigned to us. Same shall serve as a means of securing our claims to the same extent as the conditional commodity in accordance with clause 4.1. Should the conditional commodity be sold by the customer together with other goods which have not been purchased from us, the claims deriving from the resale shall be assigned to us in proportion of the invoice value of the conditional commodity to the invoice values of the other goods used. Should goods of which we have co-owner shares in accordance with clause 4.2 be sold, a portion of the claims deriving therefrom corresponding to our co-ownership share shall be assigned to us. Should the conditional commodity be used by the customer to fulfil a contract for work and services, the same proportion of the claims deriving from the contact for work and services shall be assigned to us in advance. We shall accept the aforementioned assignment of claims.4.5. The customer shall be entitled to collect claims deriving from the resale. This authorization to collect shall extinguish should it be revoked by us. We shall make use of our power of revocation only should we become aware that the customer’s financial circumstances have deteriorated so substantially as to put our claim for payment at risk, particularly in case of delay, non-payment of a bill or cheque, or an application to open insolvency proceedings. The customer shall be obliged, at our request, to immediately inform his/her customers of the assignment to us and to provide us with the documents necessary for collection.4.6. Should the terms of the contract between the third-party debtor and the customer effectively limit the right of assignment or should the third-party make assignment dependent upon his/her agreement, we are to be informed of this in writing immediately. In such case, we shall herewith be irrevocably authorized to collect the claim due to us on behalf and for the account of the customer. The customer shall, at the same time, irrevocably order the third-party debtor to remit payment to us.The customer shall immediately inform us of any attachment or other impairment by third parties. The customer shall bear all costs incurred in cancelling the attachment or in returning the conditional commodity unless same are reimbursed by third parties.4.7. Should the realizable value of the existing securities exceed our claims by a total of more than 20 %, we shall be obliged to release securities at our option at the request of the customer or a third party prejudiced by our excess security.4.8. In case of a breach of duty on the part of the customer, especially in case of delayed payment, we shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract and to demand the return of the conditional commodity - without prejudice to other claims for compensation - after the abortive expiry of a reasonable time limit for payment which the customer has been set; the statutory provisions regarding the dispensability of setting a time limit shall remain unaffected. The customer shall be obliged to surrender possession and to assign any claims for return of property. We shall be entitled to enter the customer’s premises for the purpose of retrieving the conditional commodity. The same shall apply should other circumstances arise that would suggest a substantial deterioration in the customer’s financial circumstances and put our claims for payment at risk. A credit note will be issued for the repossessed goods to the value of the original invoice amount less a lump sum payment of 10 % for each month or part thereof which elapses between delivery and repossession. We shall be entitled to provide grounds for higher compensation and the customer for lower compensation.5. Material defects and defects in title5.1. Documents and data relating to items and services supplied, as well as to the intended purpose (e.g., drawings, diagrams, dimensions, weights, practical values and other performance data), whether or not these have been specifically agreed upon in writing, are to be regarded solely as descriptions and/or identification and not as warranties, guaranteed characteristics, contractually prescribed uses, or similar, and are to be regarded as approximations. The right to make variations which are customary in this line of business is reserved insofar as same are deemed reasonable from the customer’s point of view, i.e., in particular when, as a result thereof, the value of the goods is maintained or improved.Our drivers and third-party drivers are not authorized to take delivery of notices of defects.Notices of defects shall not, under any circumstances, be accepted after the goods have been treated or processed insofar as the defect was detectable during the inspection in the state as delivered.5.2. The provisions of Section 377 of the German Commercial Code shall apply vis-à-vis merchants. In particular, the customer shall be obliged to inspect the goods carefully immediately upon their receipt, while same are in the delivered state, or upon collection, and to report any defects immediately in writing. The delivery of higher/lower quantities or heavier/lighter weights within the customary limits shall not constitute grounds for complaints and/or price reductions.5.3. Should newly manufactured items or new work performance be concerned, claims for compensation for material defects shall become statute-barred upon the expiry of 12 months from the date of delivery of the article of sale to the customer unless the customer has resold the unused article of sale and we have received from the customer the completed and signed confirmation of receipt from the purchaser immediately upon the article of sale being handed over to the purchaser; in such case, claims for compensation for material defects shall become statute-barred upon the expiry of 12 months from the date the article of sale is handed over.Should used goods be supplied, all claims for material defects will be excluded, except those claims based upon statutory regulations and any other agreements. The shortened period of limitation and exclusion from liability shall not apply in cases of intentional or negligent injury to life, body or health, in the case of an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty on our part, and in the case of fraudulent non-disclosure of a defect. The statutory regulations relating to the expiry, suspension or recommencement of periods of limitation shall remain unaffected.5.4. In case of material defects, we shall first be given the opportunity to supplement our performance within a reasonable period of time, whereby we shall have the option of either remedying the defect or of delivering a non-defective item. In the latter case, the customer shall be obliged to return the defective article to us upon our request, in accordance with the statutory regulations. Should the supplementary performance be unsuccessful, or should we finally and absolutely refuse supplementary performance, or should we be able to refuse supplementary performance pursuant to Section 439, paragraph 3, of the German Civil Code, or can the customer not be reasonably expected to accept the supplementary performance, or should Section 323, paragraph 2, of the German Civil Code be applicable in this case, the customer shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract or to reduce the valuable consideration without prejudicing any claims for compensation in accordance with clause 6.5.5. There shall be no warranty claims in case of insignificant deviations from the agreed quality, minor impairment of usefulness, natural wear and tear or damage arising after the transfer of risk as a result of improper or negligent handling and storage, excessive strain, unsuitable operating equipment, or arising from particular outside influences which are not provided for in the contract, or from non-reproducible software errors. Claims based on defects attributable to improper modifications or repair work carried out by the customer or third parties and the consequences thereof shall likewise be excluded.5.6. The customer’s right of recourse against us pursuant to Section 478 of the German Civil Code (customer’s recourse) shall be limited to cases where the customer has not concluded any agreements with his/her purchaser which exceed the scope of the statutory provisions governing claims based on defects. The extent of the customer’s right of recourse against us pursuant to Section 478, paragraph 2, of the German Civil Code shall be as specified in clause 5.7 below.5.7. The customer shall not be entitled to claim compensation for expenses incurred for the purpose of supplementary performance, in particular costs for transportation, travel, labour and material, should the expenses increase because the article of sale has subsequently been transferred to a location other than the place of business of the customer, unless said transfer is in accordance with the intended use of the item.5.8. For the rest, claims for damages shall be governed by clause 6. The customer shall not be entitled to make any further claims, or claims other than those specified in said clause, against us or our subcontractors due to a material defect.5.9. We shall not accept any liability for claims for material defects in cases where the article of sale is subject to regulations outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany which exceed the German regulations.5.10. The provisions in clauses 5.1 to 5.10 shall also apply in the case of defects in title.6. Claims of the customer based upon delayed delivery, impossibility of delivery and other breaches of duty6.1. Unless otherwise provided for in clauses 6.2 to 6.6, all claims of the customer for damages due to delayed delivery, impossibility of delivery or based on any other legal grounds, in particular due to breach of duty arising from the obligation relationship and from unlawful acts, shall be excluded. Same shall apply both to claims of the customer for damages and to claims for reimbursement of expenses.6.2. The aforesaid attributable to a negligent breach of duty on our part or to a deliberate or negligent breach of duty on the part of persons legally representing our company or one of our subcontractors,c) claims pursuant to product liability law,d) claims pursuant to any other mandatory statutory regulations, ore) due to the breach of essential contractual obligations by us.Claims for damages due to the breach of essential contractual obligations shall, however, be limited to contractually typical, foreseeable damage, provided no intent or gross negligence is involved or liability exists for negligent or wilful injury to life, body or health.Essential contractual obligations are obligations the fulfilment of which is essential for proper performance of the contract and on the observance of which the orderer may normally rely.The aforementioned rules are not coupled with any changes to the legal burden of proof to the disadvantage of the customer. Provided limited liability is permitted, liability for contractually typical, foreseeable damage shall be limited to seven (7) times the net price of the individual subject of the contract upon the delivery/non-delivery of which the customer’s claims are based.6.3. Any claims for damages or for reimbursement of expenses resulting from defects, to which the customer is entitled in accordance with clauses 6.1 and 6.2, shall become statute-barred upon expiry of the periods of limitation applicable to claims for material defects in accordance with clause 5.3 above. The statutory periods of limitation shall apply where claims are made for damages under product liability law.6.4. The aforesaid liability exemptions and limitations shall not apply in cases where a stricter liability has been contractually agreed or can be implied from the other content of the obligation relationship, also in particular with regard to the provision of a warranty or assumption of a procurement risk.6.5. The customer shall not be entitled to claim for damages in lieu of performance should our breach of obligations be negligible.6.6. Notwithstanding the aforesaid limitations, any legal right of the customer to withdraw from the contract shall remain unaffected hereby. However, in cases of a breach of obligation not related to a defect in the goods, it is required that we are responsible for said breach.7. Applicable law, venue and miscellaneous7.1. This contract shall be governed by German law with the exception of the Vienna UN Agreement of April 11, 1980.The language for negotiations shall be German.7.2. The place of performance for the customer’s obligations and for our obligations shall be the principal place of business of our company.7.3. The venue for all current and future claims arising from the business relationship, including claims based on bills of exchange and cheques, shall be Straubing should the customer be a merchant, legal entity or a special fund under public law. Said venue shall also apply when the customer has no general venue in Germany, moves his/her home or usual place of residence abroad after conclusion of the contract or if his/her address or usual place of residence is not known at the time when legal proceedings are instituted.7.4. Should any provision of these General Terms be or become invalid, the other provisions shall not be affected thereby. The invalid provision will be replaced by a valid provision, the content and purpose of which is as similar as possible to that of the invalid provision.

To cope with the challenges of a healthy agriculture, we provide technical and digital solutions for state-of-the-art farming, tillage, sowing and crop care.Our cross-media campaign #FUTUREGROUND stands for the protection of the soil for the future and for future generations. The motifs of the campaign show people in dialogue on the “ground of the future“ - symbolised by floating earth islands.Together with our customers, society and our employees etc. we develop ideas for an agriculture that is economically successful and contributes to a healthy climate on earth. Prepare the soil for a healthy exchange What if we are facing a shortage of food that is caused by the climate? What if we are facing a shortage of food that is caused by the climate?In the 2022 digital fireside chat Michael Horsch together with Josef Braun (organic farmer from Freising) and Deert Rieve (runs a conventional agricultural farm in Stralsund) discusses the climatic consequences on the production of staple foods. It basically is about the increasing influences of the climate on farming and agricultural production. Because of the crop failures caused by weather extremes the prices for rape, soya, maize but also for cereals have risen considerably. Canada for example was hit by a heat wave at the beginning of June, in China the flooding of the Yangtze led to considerable crop failures. According to statistics it was one of the biggest climate-induced damages as it mainly hit the “breadbaskets” of China. In addition, the prices are still influenced by Covid-19, the current commodity prices and the increased freight charges. However, there could be another reason for the situation in the market: namely the influence of a shortage of staple foods. Based on this assumption the discussion starts with the question if farming should completely be converted to organic farming or if there also are other problems and solutions.According to Josef Braun organic farming at least is the correct approach if you take climate protection and wildlife conservation into account: “If we want to cope with these challenges, we have to rethink the use of the land.” In the future, too, land use has to meet the requirements of nature and man. The productivity of prime locations has to be maintained. Deert Rieve, too, agrees and adds: “We cannot afford a yield reduction on prime locations!” In Braun’s opinion the “Agro-Forest” method also is a good approach. The principle of this method is to integrate trees and bushes in the fields. They, thus, lead to an improvement of the gross photosynthesis output, a reduced drawdown of the groundwater and they create better conditions for higher yields. But according to Rieve this has to happen without continuing to lose additional arable land. From an ecological and economic point of view it is important to maintain the prime locations. “We could reforest unproductive land where the negative consequences of a production caused by higher specific crop care measures are more serious”, Deert Rieve points out.All three speakers agree that our eating habits, too, as well as the high amount of wasted food play a major role. According to statistics 1/3 of the food that is produced all over the world is wasted, 42% of it legumes, 22% cereals, 5% meat, 18% potatoes, but only 1% seafood (figures according to Michael Horsch). “You see, there is a causal relationship: the more expensive a product is the less often it is wasted“, Horsch says. In his opinion, the advantage of high prices also is that less food is wasted and that we start to think more about how we feed ourselves. So finally crooked fruits and vegetables have found their way into our supermarkets. “However, we must not forget the negative consequences for the Third World. These people often can only afford bread and if the bread price doubles because of the increasing wheat price, there really will be a big problem”, Horsch states. International trade, however, is able to compensate globally for crop failures. According to Rieve, countries that for different reasons – either climate or others – cannot produce themselves, can be supplied from other locations and compensate for shortfalls. He considers it a major responsibility to support each other and to find solutions together. HORSCH is a leading global manufacturer of innovative agricultural technology and modern solutions for soil cultivation, seeding and plant protection.

Regardless of your place of residence, they will be transferred to the United States, Ireland or any other country in which Twitter Inc. has business operations, where they will be stored and used. Twitter will, firstly, process the data you provide voluntarily when you upload or synchronize them, such as your name and handle, e-mail address, telephone number and contacts in your address book. However, Twitter will also analyse the content you have shared and the topics you are interested in, store and process confidential messages that you send directly to other users, and can determine your location using GPS data, information on wireless networks or your IP address in order to send you advertising or other content. Under certain circumstances Twitter Inc. will use analysis tools such as Twitter or Google Analytics for this analysis.

These data allow targeted content or advertising to be offered to you. The fact that Twitter Inc. is a non-European provider which only has a European branch in Ireland means that it does not consider itself bound by German data protection regulations. This affects, for instance, your right to access, block or erase data or to object to the possibility of usage data being used for advertising purposes. You have ways of restricting the processing of your data in the general settings of your Twitter account and under ""Data protection and security"". With mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), you can also restrict Twitter's access to contact and calendar data, photos, location data etc. using the settings available on them.

It enables members to manage mainly business but also private contacts and link to new contacts. Organisations can set up a page on this platform with a logo and brief profile, post news items and initiate discussion groups. A personal profile with administrator rights must be assigned to the company profile. Conversations in groups can only be conducted using the personal profile of a natural person. Users must register in order to use the network function. There is a free basic version and a chargeable version with additional functions. In contrast to other social networks, XING is based more strongly on the combination of personal and electronic contact, is less commercial and is less visually oriented. It is focused on professional networking on specialist issues with people who have the same professional interests. XING is also frequently used by companies and other organisations to recruit staff and present themselves as an attractive employer. To that end XING is linked with the employer rating platform kununu. XING provides further information: https://corporate.xing.com/de/unternehmen/ HORSCH Maschinen GmbH currently makes only very limited use of XING through a brief profile and occasional posting of news items that relate primarily to current job opportunities. No topic-related discussion group is offered at present, but is conceivable in the future. Current information about data privacy can be found at https://privacy.xing.com/de/datenschutzerklaerung.
