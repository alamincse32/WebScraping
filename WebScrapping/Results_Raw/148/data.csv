For instance, a clinical trial we funded evaluating the effect of calendared blister packaging on medication adherence and health outcomes showed an uplift in both medication adherence and refill rates among patients who received their medication in blister packaging as opposed to a vial.We lower your total cost by providing a complete array of support services from R&D and design through testing, manufacturing and fulfillment.

Pharmaceutical Companies Since 2009, there has been a 281% increase in pharmaceutical spending on adherence programs Tasked with promoting a medication regimenFor pharmaceutical companies alone, global non-adherence represents revenue losses of $564 billion a year. As spending on adherence programs continues to climb, many brand owners are left wondering if programs are as effective as they could be.Too often, programs are focused around two moments in the patient's medication journey:When the physician first prescribes the medicationWhen the pharmacist counsels the patient at pick-up timeBut what happens in between and afterward?Our adherence solutions help fill the gap, reaching patients every day with a proven high-impact solution. Our customizable adherence packaging features calendared blisters as well as readable space for medication information and links to other adherence programs.This drives adherence in a scalable way, as well as building equity for your brand. Learn more about our proven ROI model and how our adherence packaging combined with patient education information drove increased adherence for a common high blood pressure medication. Retail Pharmacies Effective adherence packaging that benefits patients, society and your bottom line.Regression modeling has demonstrated that the single strongest individual predictor of prescription medication adherence was a sense of connectedness with a pharmacist or pharmacy staff. Yet, the US prescription dispensing process typically involves repackaging of pills from bulk manufacturer bottles into unit-of-use vials for patients. This consumes precious time that pharmacists could spend counseling patients or providing other value-added services.For more than a decade, WestRock has delivered statistically proven adherence packaging solutions that drive adherence for patients and efficiencies for pharmacies. Consumer-centric design for OTC solutionsOver-the-counter medications are no longer stored only on pharmacy shelves and in medicine cabinets. Instead, on-the-go consumers toss their medication packages in their purses, briefcases, glove boxes and pockets. The medication's packaging must protect the medication and fit with people's busy lives.WestRock's packaging is designed based on insights from consumers, and integrates lifestyle-friendly features such as a discreet, compact and protective outer carton. The calendared blisters help keep patients on track with their medication routine.This packaging benefits brands as well. The flat, readable billboard space on medication packages, including Shellpak® Renew, helps build brand differentiation and shelf appeal. Adherence Playbook How packaging can influence the opioid epidemic Did you know that innovative packaging can positively impact patient adherence to medication, and that non-adherence to medication has been a contributing factor to the opioid epidemic? Non-adherence to prescriptions is costly. Not only does it lead to poor health outcomes for patients, but also to missed opportunities for pharmaceutical companies.“At WestRock, we believe packaging can make a meaningful impact on combating the opioid crisis,” says Dave Dwyer, vice president of Global Marketing, Adherence. “We’ve spent years studying how innovative and informed packaging designs can help change the way patients appropriately initiate, take as prescribed and discontinue their medication. We’ve invested in rigorous, peer-reviewed, published research on how well-designed packaging can help—and that work is continuing.”Download our adherence packaging playbook to learn about the benefits of our innovative packaging designs, which can improve patient adherence to medication. Patient-Centered Design Good packaging protects medicine—and patients Global quality practices Significantly reducing misuseImproving adherenceProviding educational informationMaking lower-count dispensing easierPreventing diversion and improving trackability Patient-centered design brings ideas to life Our artwork services are customized to the healthcare industry and begin with print and artwork consultancy all the way to packaging design. We use the latest workflow technologies to incorporate effective collaboration, rapid response and full regulatory compliance. We can create labels, inserts/ leaflets and booklets, cartons, rigid and flexible packaging that is unique to the healthcare space.

Learn More About the Circular Economy Certifiably Sustainable Third-party fiber certification is one of the most important ways we demonstrate our commitment to sustainable forestry. Our multiple certifications are a testament to our responsible, sustainable and transparent sourcing and provide assurance that the paper and packaging products we make contain virgin fiber from well-managed forests. We hold ourselves and our partners to the highest standards--for our customers, our communities and the environment. We are proud to work with these forest certification organizations. Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®) SFI is an independent, non-profit organization that brings together the forest sector, conservation groups and many other stakeholders to leverage SFI-certified forests and products as powerful tools to advance sustainability. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) PEFC is a leading global alliance of national forest certification systems dedicated to promoting sustainable forest management through independent third-party certification. The Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) The Forest Stewardship Council sets standards for responsible forest management. A voluntary program, FSC uses the power of the marketplace to protect forests for future generations. American Tree Farm System (ATFS®) ATFS works to sustain forests, watersheds and healthy wildlife habitats, providing family landowners the tools they need to be effective stewards of America's forests.

How a major craft brewer replaced plastic packaging with a paper-based innovation Visiting Ska Brewing’s flagship location in the hills outside downtown Durango, Colo. is as much for the experience as it is for its spirited music-and-comic-book-inspired brews.Chill with your furry, four-legged friend in the large outdoor beer garden. Chow down in the restaurant partly made from two up-cycled shipping containers. Or venture to the upstairs meeting space for some “Happy Hour Yoga” — just $10 for a class and a pint-sized glass of Ska brew to savor when you’re done.“It’s a pretty cool draw on a quiet Monday night, and it’s a great way to start your week, especially if it was a hard Monday,” said Ska Brewing COO Steve Breezley. For this well-established Colorado brewer, appreciating the great outdoors and fostering a laid-back lifestyle are at the foundation of its brand and the attitude of its workers and customers. As a result, its leaders made efforts in past years to embrace a circular economy, one based on eliminating pollution and manufacturing products that can be reused or recycled. They made environmentally responsible choices to water the lawn with recycled water, reduce water consumption in the brewhouses, and to put craft beer in recyclable cans instead of glass simply because cans are more likely to end up on a rafting or backpacking trip. While there’s a greater chance a canned 6-pack will get put in a mesh bag, hooked to a kayak and thrown over the side to stay cool in the river, the plastic rings used to pack these cans was, for them, like that unwanted guest at your childhood birthday party—you didn’t like them, but your mom made you invite them anyway. And the leaders at Ska were determined to disinvite plastic to this outdoor-loving, yoga-posing, craft-beer-drinking party.“Our goal is to move away from plastic, for sure, and just try to minimize materials in general,” said Breezley. But isn’t plastic packaging recyclable and therefore circular?It can be recycled, but that doesn’t mean it is. Right now, it’s estimated only 15% of the world’s plastic is recycled.1 Additionally, plastic rings are refused by most trash recyclers as they’re considered a “hard-to-recycle"" plastic. One company even made its niche in promising to recycle difficult plastics, and according to a Bloomberg report, they may be failing at it. When it comes to plastic in general, most trash collectors won’t recycle it because there are no plastic recyclers who’ll take it from them, which means they end up throwing it in their landfills.2 Why? Most of them used to send plastic recycling to China, and without that as an option now, recyclers have nowhere else to go. There are few domestic partners to choose from because there’s no market for it; recycling plastic is expensive and it’s just cheaper to make more. There has to be a better option The founders of Ska brewing knew their plastic was ending up in landfills, which didn’t sit well with these outdoorsmen. “We explored alternatives, looking for a solution that would deliver in terms of durability and appearance, while also reducing environmental impact,” said Breezley. At the time they found more disappointment than cost-effective solutions. The team considered wrapping the entire six-pack in recyclable paperboard (traditionally done for 12-packs), but they determined that would increase their current cost of production and also the energy and resources needed to produce the packaging. Another option, using plastic can lids, would mean that wildlife wouldn’t have to contend with plastic rings, but it would increase their usage of single-use plastic. The Ska Brewing team knew there had to be a better way. Enter WestRock, a global leader in innovative fiber-based packaging solutions. COVID slowed down Ska’s search, and once the pandemic-dust settled the team realized WestRock had just released a new alternative called CanCollar®. This option provided the team with everything they needed and wanted. The fiber-based CanCollar solution uses approximately 95% less plastic3 while keeping the costs comparable. “CanCollar immediately reduces the amount of plastic Ska contributes to the environment by approximately four tons a year,” said Breezley. “The innovation, ethos and ethics behind this solution are what we’re all about.” Other beverage makers already using CanCollar include Asahi Breweries, a Japanese-based brewer, and Mexico-based Grupo Modelo, makers of Modelo and Corona beer, along with more than 150 craft breweries across North America. Grupo Modelo’s transition at their plant in Quintana Roo is expected to reduce the company’s use of single-use plastic by 100 tons a year.4 “It’s exciting to see CanCollar helping businesses in the beverage industry meet their sustainable packaging goals,” said Sam Shoemaker, WestRock President of Consumer Packaging. “These businesses, including Ska Brewing, are great examples of how others can replace plastic and make an efficient and smooth transition to fiber-based solutions.” Ready for sweeping legislation against plastic Over 500 municipalities in 28 states have passed some kind of ban or fine on single-use plastics, mostly affecting consumers. The Canadian federal government is taking huge measures to ban the production and import of single-use plastics, including six-pack rings, by 2025. And Europe has also taken a hard stance with the EU banning the sale of many single-use plastics in 2021, such as plastic cutlery, plates, straws, and balloon sticks. Additionally, following Maine and Oregon, Colorado passed legislation in May of 2022 requiring manufacturers using certain materials, like plastic, to fund a statewide recycling program. Because Ska is using WestRock’s CanCollar packaging, the company expects to pay lower dues to the program compared to other craft brewers still using plastic rings.Capitalizing on sustainability and technology grants To automate the application of CanCollar to its six-packs, Ska decided to purchase the WestRock Corsair™ solution for use in its brewery. Implementing the Corsair meant that switching to CanCollar would not require more manpower and would allow the team to continue packaging cans at its current rate. The machine would also make it possible for Ska to package new offerings, such as four-packs of their 16-ounce cans. To support this major investment, Ska applied for a Colorado state grant aimed at providing funds for “implementing early-stage technology” (and it would be the first craft brewery in the country to implement this technology). With the added benefit of helping the environment, the state’s Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) saw Ska Brewing as a worthy candidate and awarded them the grant. Providing a good percentage of their overall investment, the OEDIT made it easier for Ska to purchase the Corsair and put their new CanCollar six-packs on shelves starting in April 2023. “OEDIT's Advanced Industries Accelerator Program supports innovative companies that are disrupting their industries, and Ska Brewing is certainly revolutionizing the brewing industry with its packaging technology for environmentally friendly CanCollars,” said Rama Haris, Colorado’s Advanced Industries senior manager of global business development. Encouraging sustainability among brewers and beverage manufacturers With the right solution in place, Ska’s leaders are now able to focus their collective attention on other matters, such as new brews and introducing their new four-packs. They say they’re not the only ones loving their new packaging. “We actually just ran out of our first 16-ounce four-packs,” said Breezley. “When there are 12 IPAs in front of you, it's hard to grab attention. (CanCollar) helps set us apart from some of our competitors in a positive way, because the feedback we've already had is like, ‘I love seeing this. It's great. You guys don't have plastic.’” Since craft brewers embrace collaboration over competition, Ska Brewing Founder Dave Thibodeau hopes what they’re doing will not only encourage other brewers but also allow them to consult and guide others through the process of making the change to fiber-based packaging. “At the end of the day, we’d like to see all companies using less plastic. So, an even better scenario would be if the beer sitting next to ours on the shelf was also using CanCollar.” WestRock is a global industry leader in fiber-based packaging.

Recycled fiber vs. virgin fiber While packaging made from 100% recycled material may seem like the optimal choice, the need for virgin fiber, or fresh material, is essential and also supports sustainability. Businesses big and small are doing their part to reduce waste and limit greenhouse gas emissions by working toward a more sustainable future. While there are many ways to advance sustainability, one of them is for companies to adopt better, more responsible packaging solutions. A common thought is that packaging made from 100% recycled material is the optimal choice. But in fact, the need for virgin fiber, or fresh material, is essential and also supports sustainability. How virgin fiber complements recycled fiber You can't have a sustainable, circular economy without a constant supply of high-quality virgin fiber enabling the existence of recycled fiber. WestRock's virgin fiber, or fiber not previously used to produce paper or packaging products, is sourced from responsibly managed forests. We also partner with organizations like The Center for Heirs' Property Preservation® to drive social equity through sustainable forestry. Alternatively, our recycled fiber comes from used paper and packaging collected through either WestRock's dedicated recycling plants or from partnerships with national haulers. While it would be ideal to infinitely reuse fiber-based products, the reality is that the fibers in paper and packaging can only be recycled between five and seven times before it becomes unsuitable for most products. Each time recycled fiber is processed, the individual strands drop in quality and strength. Without adding fresh fiber into the mix, recycled paper and packaging would run out within 8-13 months1. Therefore, virgin fiber remains vital to a sustainable, circular packaging operation. Supply chain inefficiencies, shifting costs and transportation demands are also factors. Making an environmentally friendly packaging choice can’t be done simply by deciding between recycled or virgin sources. Instead, consider whether the decision makes sense for environmental objectives and whether the supplier supports sustainability throughout the papermaking process. How virgin fiber benefits the circular economy Sustainable forestry is at the heart of WestRock's operations. Planting trees, harvesting them at the right time and converting them into responsible forest products are crucial to a more sustainable future. WestRock works with partners who consider sustainability every step of the way and operate in areas that are forest positive— that means planting more trees in the procurement basin than what they harvest, ensuring the environment remains healthy and productive. Flourishing sustainable forests confer significant ecological benefits alongside virgin fiber production. Sustainable forests can directly contribute to: Clean water Wildlife diversity Carbon sequestration Recreation: Forests often serve as vibrant recreation areas for local communities, and WestRock has invested in providing access to urban greenspaces. Beyond these upsides, responsibly harvesting forests is also good for the landscape's long-term health. When a forest becomes overcrowded with trees, the lack of space, water and sunlight means the canopy and understory struggle to achieve productive growth. Without virgin fiber harvesting, maximizing regeneration and biodiversity in forested environments can be difficult, and fire hazards can also arise.How we're driving fiber-based innovation Virgin fiber is essential to a sustainable, circular economy. WestRock's forestry practices help to ensure these resources achieve the most benefit: Through collaborative relationships with landowners in the U.S. and abroad, we provide extensive education, guidance and support for sustainable forest management. We create economic incentives for private landowners and family tree farmers to continue using their land for working forests, ensuring these vast regions provide crucial carbon sequestration, freshwater supplies and diverse habitats. We're driving innovation through smarter fiber-based packaging solutions and closed-loop programs alongside sustainable partnerships with companies like Kraft-Heinz, Grupo Modelo and Swiss Chalet. Grupo Modelo: CanCollar® WestRock worked with Grupo Modelo to develop CanCollar: a durable, recyclable paperboard-based multipack solution for cans, with patent-pending tooth design and wet strength. Learn More Swiss Chalet Recyclable Paperboard Packaging WestRock partners with Swiss Chalet to launch recyclable paperboard packaging, an important step toward sustainability goals. Learn More Reducing waste and emissions with collaborative ideas WestRock partners with the world's leading companies to deliver packaging solutions that carefully consider natural resources and enhance our response to the changing marketplace as well as consumer interests. We helped support Kraft-Heinz sustainability goals and better reflect consumer demand by developing a recyclable paperboard sleeve for its multi-can products. This no-glue innovation uses 50% less material than a traditional wraparound box while reducing CO2 emissions by 18.7% compared to the equivalent shrink-wrap design.2 Similarly, we partnered with iconic Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo on implementing CanCollar® – a paperboard-based alternative to plastic rings for beverage multipacks. Durable enough to withstand the moist conditions inside a brewery, this forward-thinking design is expected to reduce plastic waste by more than 100 tons annually.3 Developing closed-loop systems with General Motors Commercial operations are also vital to the recycling process, with the right approach helping to ensure natural resources are used to their maximum potential. WestRock recently helped General Motors establish a closed-loop recyclable virgin fiber packaging system, highlighting how virgin and recycled sources work together to produce sustainable outcomes. As a one-stop supplier and recycling partner, we produce specially designed fiber-based products for General Motors and pick up and move into our mill system almost 17,000 tons of recyclable material per year across just five of GM’s plants. With the reclaimed virgin materials soon beginning a new life as recycled products, this program also supported GM’s Zero Waste goal to divert greater than 90% of their operational waste from landfills and thermal processing facilities by 2025. WestRock is honored to support its customers’ progress toward their sustainability goals while creating less waste and enabling a circular paper-based economy. How to choose the right fiber mix WestRock offers a diverse range of packaging options including those that use 100% recycled fiber. A range of questions can help businesses select sustainable packaging that also achieve business objectives and fulfills environmental needs: Know what's driving the need: Consider the reasons for choosing a fully recycled product. From customer expectations to industry standards, motivation might determine which product makes the most sense. Consider the intended use: Recycled paper-based products can be a great choice but the intended application matters. Strength and durability demands influence the ideal packaging decision.Explore options: While many of WestRock's products are 100% recyclable, others feature a combination of virgin and recycled fiber to improve longevity and performance. Get to know the range of options. Drive innovation: If there isn’t a 100% recycled option, there may be an opportunity to create an innovative product. WestRock's research and development team can help customize a packaging solution. Questions to Help Choose the Right Fiber Mix What's driving the need?What is the intended use?Which options help achieve your goals?Are there opportunities for product innovation? Contact Us Choose the ideal fiber-based packaging The ultimate target for WestRock and its customers is a more sustainable future. Yet it's imperative to understand that achieving this is not necessarily a question of virgin or recycled fiber.

Advancing social equity through forestry WestRock partners with The Center for Heirs' Property Preservation to help advance social equity through sustainable forestry Sustainably managed forests are critical to industries like ours that depend on a steady supply of quality fiber. That’s one reason why WestRock invests in programs and partnerships that provide resources, education and incentives to enable family landowners to manage their land. More importantly, we invest to help ensure a family’s forestland is a financial asset, not a burden, to be passed along to future generations. We spoke to Lowcountry landowner Jacqueline Fields whose great-great-grandfather acquired land once emancipated after 22 years of slavery. By working with The Center for Heirs’ Property Preservation®, Jacqueline has been able to maintain rights to her property and unlock the economic potential so that the land can become a source of income for her family. What is heirs' property? Heirs’ property is land that has been passed down generation after generation without the benefit of a will, so the land is owned in common by all heirs in the region, regardless of whether they live on the land, pay taxes or perhaps have never set foot on the property. As a result, heirs' property is at high risk for loss because any heir can sell their percentage of ownership to someone that can force the sale of the entire property, often at an unfair price. Learn More The Center for Heirs’ Property Preservation®, based in Charleston, S.C., is advancing social equity through sustainable forestry. The organization assists underserved landowners to take control of their land and utilize it to build generational wealth for their families through equitable land management.In Jacqueline’s case, the Center connected her with David Bourgeois, a forester who helps landowners determine how to make their property more profitable and work more efficiently. Through the Center, they secured funding to thin her trees, jumpstarting the forest to make it grow faster. Now that it is on a new growth trajectory, Jacqueline will be able to harvest the land much sooner than expected and increase the value of her property over time. “It means everything to me because it’s a legacy. With it being in the family for one, two, three, four generations and possibly going to a fifth and sixth, it has a different meaning for me than other land that I own. It’s property that I want to stay forever in the family.” Jacqueline Fields landowner By helping landowners from historically underserved communities use sustainable forestry to turn their family land into a financial asset, the Center is making a lasting impact on these communities. As we imagine and deliver on the promise of a sustainable future, we're honored to celebrate the Center's work. Through our multi-year partnership, WestRock has committed to ensuring more landowners are able to realize the full potential of their family forestland and drive sustainable forestry. Together, we will deliver on the promise of a sustainable future as we Innovate boldly. Package sustainably.™ Thank You! Subscribe for more!
