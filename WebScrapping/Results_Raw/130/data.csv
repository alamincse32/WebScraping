Our drag conveyors feature a three piece trough design made up of a bolted drop bottom and sides. All drag conveyors come with galvanized covers and clamps. The chain can be steel flighted or UHMW plastic flighted. They are able to run at 0-7 degrees using standard flighted chain, 7.1-15 degrees with high flight chain, and 15.1-45 degrees using paddle flighted chain. Drag Conveyor sizes range from 8”-32” wide x 10”-30” high. Howell guarantees capacity with the least amount of product damage with minimal maintenance. Ful-Flo Drag Conveyors are available in painted mild steel, stainless steel, and galvanized. S-M Enterprises works around Moorhead, Fargo, Alexandria, and Grand Forks. We look forward to building the drag conveyor that fits your elevator and equipment needs. Request Quote Download Manual I Series I Drag Conveyors Series I Drag conveyors come in 10”, 14”, and 18” heights and 8”, 12”, 16”, 20”, 24”, 30”, and 32” widths. Series I Conveyors use 81X or 81XH chain depending on the size. All Series I Conveyors will have 1½” flanges. Series I Conveyors range from 500-20,000 BPH. Series I Head Section Series I Head Sections are constructed with 7 ga. material. They can have either flange or pillow block bearings, and use a keyed shaft and sprocket. They also feature a slack chain device, and plug switch. The Head section may have 8” take-ups if there is no room for them on the tail section. Series I Trough Section Series I Trough Sections are available with 7 ga., 1/4”, or 3/8” Abrasive Resistant steel bottom, or UHMW plastic lined mild steel 10 ga. bottom. Side liners include 10 ga., 7 ga., or ¼” Abrasive Resistant Steel or UHMW plastic. Howell conveyors use return rail with UHMW plastic on which the chain returns to head, wider conveyors will also use tip rails to prevent the chain from twisting during conveying. Series I Detector Tail Section Series I Detector Tail Sections are constructed with 10 ga. material, and use flange bearings. Detector Tails utilize compression spring at the ends of the take ups to automatically take out slack from the chain during operation. This eliminates the need to manually tension the chain. This automatic style of take up also utilizes a shut off switch so that if the conveyor gets jammed or plugged it will immediately shut down the conveyor, preventing extensive damage. The same is true if the chain becomes too loose. If there is a clearance issue a standard tail must be used. *Detector Tails are only available on conveyors with an incline less than 15 degrees* Series I Tail Section Series I Tail Sections are constructed with 10 ga. material. They can have either flange or roller pillow block bearings. Tails will have 8” take-ups for tensioning. If there is a clearance issue they can be mounted on the head or reversed upon customer request. In this case the tail becomes an idler box. In some cases the tail may have the drive. II Series II Tail Section Series II Tail Sections are constructed with 10 ga. or 7 ga. material. They can have either flange or pillow block bearings. Tails will have 8” take-ups for tensioning. If there is a clearance issue they can be mounted on the head or reversed upon customer request. In this case the tail becomes an idler box. In some cases the tail will have the drive. III DRAG CONVEYOR ACCESSORIES Discharge Transition Discharge transitions are made from 10 ga. material and can be made to go from the head or intermediate discharge flange down to any desired size square or round. Transitions can be lined with Abrasion Resistant Steel, Ceramic, or Urethane. Head Shut-off Gate Head shut-off gates are made of 10 ga. material and can be manually operated with the use of a cable, chain or hand wheel, or they can be electrically operated. Intermediate Discharge Gate Intermediate discharge gates are made of 10 ga. material and can be manually operated with the use of a cable, chain or hand wheel, or they can be electrically operated. Knee Bend Section Knee bend sections are designed to incline a drag conveyor after it runs horizontal. This is to get the desired discharge height without inclining the entire conveyor. They can incline 5-45 degrees depending on what is needed. They are constructed from the same material as the trough. Bypass Inlet Bypass inlets can be a variety of different sizes. They are available with grating for use as a dump pit, or with a companion flange. The purpose of the bypass inlet is to direct the product around the returning chain with the use of a hogback, and enter the conveyor through the sides. This allows the conveyor to be flood fed without plugging because the bypass inlet only allows what the conveyor can handle. This is ideal for truck or rail receiving pits, or for reclaiming storage bins. Standard Inlet Standard inlets are field installed where product is to enter the conveyor. They include a hogback to divert the product over the chain and return rail. Combo Inlet Gate Combo inlet gates are much like a standard inlet, except they have a door that can be closed to shut-off product flow into the conveyor. These can be manually operated with the use of a cable, chain or hand wheel, or they can be electrically operated. Ladder Inlet Gate Ladder inlet gates allow controlled flow of product into a conveyor which allows the conveyor to be flood fed. These can be manually operated with the use of a cable, chain or hand wheel, or they can be electrically operated. Heat Sensors and Speed Monitors Upon customer request bearing heat sensors and shaft speed sensors can be installed.

However the cups will hold five degrees over that level and the capacity may be based on that. Howell legs use an adjustable shroud to control airflow, and to center grain flow in the discharge. This can increase your facilities profit by reducing grain damage caused by pre discharging and down legging. We pride ourselves on the durability, strength and low maintenance of our legs, which are available in painted mild steel, stainless steel, and galvanized steel, and also include abrasive resistant wear points. S-M Enterprises works around Moorhead, Fargo, Alexandria, and Grand Forks. We look forward to building the grain and feed legs that fits your elevator and equipment needs. Download Manual Leg Head The Howell head section is constructed with 10 ga. base and a 12 ga. two piece hood design. The head is designed with reinforcement to withstand the extreme torque that drive components produce. Each head section uses two or four bolt roller pillow block bearings with an adjustment bolt to provide easy shimming to achieve proper alignment of the lagged crowned pulley. Abrasive Resistant steel, ceramic, or urethane liners are also available in three different patterns depending on the desired amount of wear protection. 5-30 hp legs use a universal motor mount, while 40+ hp uses a motor specific mount which uses adjustment bolts. The base section has a weather proof inspection door for inspecting the pulley. There is also a weather proof maintenance door for servicing the discharge spout. The hood has a relief door on top, and inspection door to check for proper discharging. Howell legs also use an adjustable shroud to fine tune the grain flow which allows maximum capacity of the leg. Leg Casing Howell leg casing is constructed with 12 ga. or 10 ga. and either 1½” or 2” flanges depending on the size of the leg. Each 10’ section of leg is made up of a down leg and an up leg which is supported to each other with tie braces. There is also an inspection section that has a 5’ door for installing belt and cups, and an inspection door to check that cups are filling properly. This inspection section is constructed with 10 ga. or 7 ga. depending on the size of the leg. Explosion panels are also available upon request. Leg Boot The Howell Boot section is constructed with 7 ga. or ¼” depending on the size of the leg. The boot uses four bolt flange bearings with 12” travel screw type take ups to adjust belt tension and uses a crowned or winged pulley. The boot uses an inlet that is mounted at or above the center line of the pulley for optimal performance. The boot is a completely bolt together design. Howell also makes a Back Leg Roll, which is used when there is minimal space to install a leg. This allows the boot to use a smaller pulley than the head to decrease its size. Leg Platforms, Ladder, and Cage Howell also offers Head Service Platforms, Distributor Platforms, and Rest Platforms as options, which easily mount to the casing. The ladder and cage is supplied with brackets to attach to the tie braces on each leg casing. Heat Sensors and Speed Monitors Upon customer request bearing heat sensors and shaft speed sensors can be installed. Legs also are available with belt alignment sensors. Explosion Suppression Explosion suppression is available on all Legs upon customer request. This can greatly reduce damage and injury as the result of a dust explosion.
