The founders Dave Currier, his brother Dan Currier, and father Dick Currier all joined forces and started the company from their backyard garage in 1972. The family business soon outgrew the garage and transformed into the company you know today. The company’s success in the 1970’s led to the creation of multiple companies along the way. DFC Company became the parent company to Dakota Fence and its five operating companies –Dakota Playground, 3D Specialties, Sign Solutions USA, Park & Play USA, and Town & Country Fence. DFC Company, through its operating companies, sells and installs all types of fencing, traffic control equipment, highway guardrail, commercial playgrounds, park site amenities, signs, and more. In 2015, Joe Currier took over as President and CEO of DFC Company. Joe and his siblings John Currier and Amy Mickelson own DFC Company and steer it into the future. Our offices are located across North Dakota in Fargo, West Fargo, Bismarck, Minot, and Williston, as well as in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. After all these years, Dakota Fence is still a family business, and we look forward to serving you soon on your next project. Our Locations FARGO, ND | CORPORATE OFFICE 1110 25th Ave. N.

Additionally, we may ask you to create a username and password that should only be known to you. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous. Moreover, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us. Payments. We may, at Company’s discretion, provide paid products and/or services within the Website. In that case, we may use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors). We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our trusted third-party payment processors, such as BNG Gateway whose use of your Personal Information is governed by their privacy policy available at https://www.bngpayments.net/privacy-policy-payments/ . These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information. Automated Information Collection In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website. We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools may collect information about your behavior and your computer system, such as your internet address (IP Address), the pages you have viewed, and the actions you have taken while using the Website. Some of the tools we use to automatically collect information about you may include: Cookies. A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive. Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use either (or both) of them: session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire. We may use the following categories of cookies on our Website. Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as maintaining a record of your purchased items, cannot be provided. Performance Cookies. These cookies collect anonymous information on how you use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our Website, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve, such as navigation. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established. Functionality Cookies. These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters. This information can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make your visits to our Website more tailored to your preferences. The information in these cookies may be anonymized. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks. These cookies remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties. Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality. Google Analytics. The Website sends aggregated non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the Website’s performance. For more information on how Google Analytics supports the Website and uses information sent from the Website, please review Google’s privacy policy available at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. Google Places. Google Places is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests and is operated by Google. Google Places services may collect information from you and from your device for security purposes. To learn more about Google Places, please review Google’s privacy policy at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. Web Beacons. A Web Beacon is an electronic image. Web Beacons can track certain things from your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior. If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of the third-party marketers we engage with may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our Website. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information. Please note that any image file on a webpage can act as a Web Beacon. Embedded Web Links. Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns. Third-party Websites and Services. We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our Website and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites. In addition, we may use remarketing services from Google Ads, Bing Ads, and Facebook. How We Use Your Information The information we gather and that you provide is collected to provide you information and the services you request, in addition to various other purposes, including, but not limited to: providing the information, products and services you request; security, credit or fraud prevention purposes; providing you with effective customer service; providing you with a personalized experience when you use this Website; contacting you with special offers and other information we believe will be of interest to you (in accordance with any privacy preferences you have expressed to us); contacting you with information and notices related to your use of this Website; inviting you to participate in surveys and providing feedback to us (in accordance with any privacy preferences you have expressed to us); better understanding your needs and interests; improving the content, functionality and usability of this Website; improving our products and services; improving our marketing and promotional efforts; and any other purpose identified in an applicable privacy notice, click-through agreement or other agreement between you and us.

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we may have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for one or more business purposes: Identifiers; Personal Information categories; Commercial information; Internet or other network activity information; Professional or employment-related information; and Inferences drawn from other Personal Information.

Your Choices and Selecting Your Privacy Preferences We want to provide you with relevant information that you have requested. When possible, we will always provide options as to what information we collect and how you can manage any preferences that pertains to such information. If we ever provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed. Transactional or service-oriented messages, such as delivery confirmation messages, are usually excluded from such preferences, as such messages are required to respond to your requests or to provide goods and services, and are not intended for the purposes of marketing. We may utilize trusted third-party partners for CRM and email marketing services, such as Constant Contact and HubSpot.

Your Consumer Rights Some state laws in the United States provide consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information (also known as “personal data”), as those terms are defined under those applicable state laws. Such state laws may include, but are not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), and Connecticut’s Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy (“CACPDOM”).

We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
