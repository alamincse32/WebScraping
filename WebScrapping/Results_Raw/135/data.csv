Call us at 866-822-9145 for a free quote on the most reliable bins in the industry. Request a QuoteView Capacity InfoBin Applications The closer you look, the bigger the Superior advantages get. ROOF Roof Load: Superior’s roofs can withstand ground snow loads of 40 pounds per square foot and winds up to 90 mph. Farm bins come standard with an 8,000lb peak roof load, or an optional 15,000lb peak roof load. Rigidized Roof Ribs: 3-1/2-inch-deep rigidized roof ribs are locked to the roof wind ring, so the roof acts as a single, dynamic unit. Corrugation: Flat portions of the roof panel are corrugated for additional strength and finished with a formed drip edge. Roof Vents: Pre-punched 20-by-20-inch roof vents are made from a high-molecular-weight polyethylene that is injected with a U.V. inhibitor prior to fabrication. A 1-inch tall ridge surrounding the vent hole prevents moisture from entering the bin. Continuous Eave Angle: The continuous eave angle spreads the roof load evenly onto the sidewall sheets. Bird Clips: Push-up bird clips on eave angles minimize parts and labor. Wind Rings: Individual pipe sections are clamped and fastened to the roof with a locking bracket at every rib. This adds security and durability by eliminating twisting and displacement. Formed Peak Ring: Superior’s formed peak ring has three breaks instead of one to resist deformation. The roof panel rests on the peak ring and is pressed into a foam closure to seal it against wind-driven snow or rain. EXTERIOR ACCESS 66-inch Doors: (Standard) Feature a heavy-duty, bolted construction for strength and reliability. The outer door latches on the top and bottom for secure protection against rain or snow. The three inner doors open 170 degrees so you have an easy and unobstructed path into and out of the bin. Bin Step: (Standard) For safe and easy access, all Superior farm bins come with a standard bin step. Bin Stairs and Platform: (Optional) Superior bin stairs provide secure access to the bin’s eave. Galvanized stairways with adjustable treads will stand up to the elements and ensure safety for years. A 34-by-60-inch platform, the largest in the industry, comes standard with stair packages. Peak Walk-Around: (Optional) Platforms add security and provide ample room for performing service. The bolt-together galvanized construction eliminates platform failure, rust formation or the chance of welds cracking. Roof Ladder Package: A roof ladder is standard on all Superior bins. For additional safety, add an optional roof ladder handrail package. Interior Ladder: (Standard) An interior ladder comes standard on all Superior bins. Exterior Ladder and Platforms: (Optional) Exterior ladder packages are available for bin access. HERCULOK FLOORS Strength: Herculok floors are formed without removing steel for additional strength. Ribbed Flashing: Ribbed flashing provides strength for taller eave heights and traction for Superior sweep wheels. Interlocking Design: An interlocking design features a locking tab when the planks are snapped together, ensuring the floor stays in place. Heavy-Duty Herculok Floors: Heavy-Duty Herculok floors come standard on 48′ – 54′ diameter bins and are optional on 15′ – 42′ diameter bins. Herculok Z-supports: Z-Supports feature multiple vertical breaks and interlocking tabs for increased strength and stability. Welded Supports: Welded supports provide extra strength for larger bin needs. Herculok Canola: (Optional) Herculok canola floors feature 8 percent openings that keep smaller grains from impeding airflow. UNLOAD AND POWER SWEEP SYSTEMS Unloading Speeds: 11-inch U-trough achieves unloading speeds up to 6,000 bushels per hour without damaging kernels. Discharge Covers: Hinged discharge covers are easy to open and close. Latch the cover open when unloading. During the off-season, you can close and latch the cover shut to prevent snow or rodents from entering the unload. Rack-and-Pinion Gates: All sumps are covered with rack-and-pinion gates that are fixed with roller bearings for easy opening and closing. Independent Next-to-Center Sump: A next-to-center sump that opens independently from the other intermediate sumps can be opened if the center sump becomes plugged. Double Flighting: Double flighting in the center sump increases unload capacity. 16:1 Gear Reduction: An aggressive 16:1 gear reduction wheel propels the sweep into the grain mass for faster and easier unloads. STRENGTH Grade 50 Steel: Superior bins use Grade 50 steel that has a tensile strength up to 65,000 psi. G-90 Bright Galvanization: A G-90 bright galvanized steel coating provides enduring protection against the elements. JS500 Grade 8.2 Bolts: All bins come standard with JS500 grade 8.2 bolts, which are seven times more resistant for exceptional protection compared to standard galvanized bolts. 3/8-inch Bolts: Superior uses 3/8-inch bolts on all farm bin sidewall sheets, making the bin easier to erect and stronger than the competition. 44-Inch Base Anchor Stiffeners: 44-inch base anchor stiffeners boosts strength and stability. The anchor holds the bin down and provides extra strength on the bottom ring where the force of grain is greatest. Pre-Rolled Base Angle: Superior’s farm bins come standard with a pre-rolled base angle and a foam sealant gasket to protect the bin from the elements. Bottom Ring Warranty: Superior bottom ring comes with a lifetime warranty. AERATION Fan Hanging Kits: (Optional) Superior’s Fan hanging kits allow the fan to settle with the bin, which protects the transition. Fan Transitions: Superior fan transitions direct the airflow from the fan to the bin and are designed to fit any type of fan. Low-Speed Centrifugal Fans: Low-speed centrifugal fans provide greater airflow than the industry standard. Operating at 1,750 rpm, these fans are the ideal choice for most drying conditions and are much quieter than other types of fans. High-Speed Centrifugal Fans: High-speed centrifugal fans are squirrel cage fans that run at 3,500 rpm. These small fans move low volumes of air at low to moderately high static pressures, so they are ideal for aeration with deep grain depths. High-Speed Vane Axial Fans: High-speed vane axial fans in a cylindrical housing also run at 3,500 rpm. These are typically used on smaller bins. Fan Heaters: (Optional) Fan heaters speed drying time by heating air from the fan before it reaches the plenum area.

Independent Next-to-Center Sump: A next-to-center sump that opens independently from the other intermediate sumps can be opened if the center sump becomes plugged. Double Flighting: Double flighting in the center sump increases unload capacity. 16:1 Gear Reduction: An aggressive 16:1 gear reduction wheel propels the sweep into the grain mass for faster and easier unloads. STRENGTH Stiffeners: Superior stiffeners are roll formed for a consistently perfect fit. Splice connections on three planes provide critical load bearing transfer between stiffener sections. Sidewall Wind Rings: Sidewall wind ring brackets bolt directly to the center of the stiffener for increased load capacity. They are designed with an open top for easy installation of the 2 – 1/2″ galvanized wind ring pipe and secured with a stand off closure. Grade 50 Steel: Superior bins use Grade 50 steel that has a tensile strength up to 65,000 psi. G-90 Bright Galvanization: A G-90 bright galvanized steel coating provides enduring protection against the elements. JS500 Grade 8.2 Bolts: All bins come standard with JS500 grade 8.2 bolts, which are seven times more resistant for exceptional protection compared to standard galvanized bolts. 3/8-inch Bolts: Superior uses 3/8-inch bolts on all farm bin sidewall sheets, making the bin easier to erect and stronger than the competition. Pre-Rolled Base Angle: Superior’s farm bins come standard with a pre-rolled base angle and a foam sealant gasket to protect the bin from the elements. AERATION Fan Hanging Kits: (Optional) Superior’s Fan hanging kits allow the fan to settle with the bin, which protects the transition. Fan Transitions: Superior fan transitions direct the airflow from the fan to the bin and are designed to fit any type of fan. Low-Speed Centrifugal Fans: Low-speed centrifugal fans provide greater airflow than the industry standard. Operating at 1,750 rpm, these fans are the ideal choice for most drying conditions and are much quieter than other types of fans. High-Speed Centrifugal Fans: High-speed centrifugal fans are squirrel cage fans that run at 3,500 rpm. These small fans move low volumes of air at low to moderately high static pressures, so they are ideal for aeration with deep grain depths. High-Speed Vane Axial Fans: High-speed vane axial fans in a cylindrical housing also run at 3,500 rpm and are typically used on smaller bins. Fan Heaters: (Optional) Fan heaters speed drying time by heating air from the fan before it reaches the plenum area.

Superior’s commercial grain storage bins are built to stand-up to the biggest loads and toughest weather. They carry vertical loads to the foundation to resist winds up to 90-miles an hour and feature one of the industry’s strongest roofs. We understand that each bin holds more than grain, it holds your livelihood, so nothing except superior performance and reliability will do. Call us at 866-822-9145 for a free quote on the most reliable bins in the industry. Request a QuoteVIEW CAPACITY INFO The closer you look, the bigger the Superior advantages get. STRUCTURED ROOF Galvanized Rafters: Single and double C-channel rafters provide exceptional support for Superior structured roofs. Galvanized X-Bracing: Galvanized X-Bracing provides for secure alignment of rafters and roof sheets. Tension Purlins: Tension purlins are designed to go into tension as the weight of the roof pushes down and stabilizes both the roof and sidewall sheets in order to eliminate distortion. Roof Load: Superior’s roofs can withstand ground snow loads of 40 pounds per square foot and winds up to 90 mph. Roof Ribs: 3-1/2-inch-deep rigidized roof ribs are locked to the roof wind ring, so the roof acts as a single, dynamic unit. Corrugation: The flat portion of the roof panel is corrugated for additional strength and finished with a formed drip edge. Roof Vents: Pre-punched 20-by-20-inch roof vents are made from a high-molecular-weight polyethylene that is injected with a U.V. inhibitor prior to fabrication. A 1-inch tall ridge surrounding the vent hole prevents moisture from entering the bin. Continuous Eave Angle: The continuous eave angle spreads the roof load evenly onto the sidewall sheets. Bird Clips: Push-up bird clips on eave angles minimize parts and labor. Wind Rings: Individual pipe sections are clamped and fastened to the roof with a locking bracket at every rib. This adds security and durability by eliminating twisting and displacement. Formed Peak Ring: Superior’s formed peak ring has three breaks instead of one to resist deformation. The roof panel rests on the peak ring and is pressed into a foam closure to seal it against wind-driven snow or rain. Bin Diameter Panels Standard Roof Optional Roof 30′ – 54′ Single-panel 15,000 pound – 60′ Single-panel 15,000 pound 30,000 pound 50,000 pound 75′, 90′, 105′ Multi-panel 30,000 pound 50,000 pound EXTERIOR ACCESS Bin Step: (Standard) For safe and easy access, all Superior farm bins come with a standard bin step. Bin Stairs and Platform: (Optional) Superior bin stairs provide secure access to the bin’s eave. Galvanized stairways with adjustable treads will stand up to the elements and ensure safety for years. A 34-by-60-inch platform, the largest in the industry, comes standard with stair packages. Roof Ladder Package: A roof ladder is standard on all Superior bins. For additional safety, add an optional roof ladder handrail package. Peak Walk-Around: (Optional) Platforms add security and provide ample room for performing service. The bolt-together galvanized construction eliminates platform failure, rust formation or the chance of welds cracking. Interior Ladder: (Standard) An interior ladder comes standard on all Superior bins. Exterior Ladder and Platforms: (Optional) Exterior ladder packages are available for bin access. HERCULOK FLOORS Strength: Herculok floors are formed without removing steel for additional strength. Ribbed Flashing: Ribbed flashing provides strength for taller eave heights and traction for Superior sweep wheels. Interlocking Design: An interlocking design features a locking tab when the planks are snapped together, ensuring the floor stays in place. Heavy-Duty Herculok Floors: Heavy-Duty 18 gauge Herculok floors are standard on 48′ – 54′ diameter bins and optional on 15′ – 42′ diameter bins. Herculok floors are also available for 60′ – 75′ bins with eave heights up to 66 feet. Herculok Z-supports: Z-Supports feature multiple vertical breaks and interlocking tabs for increased strength and stability. Welded Supports: Welded supports provide extra strength for larger bin needs. Herculok Canola: (Optional) Herculok canola floors feature 8 percent openings that keep smaller grains from impeding airflow. UNLOAD AND POWER SWEEP SYSTEMS Unloading Speeds: 11-inch U-trough achieves unloading speeds up to 6,000 bushels per hour without damaging kernels. Discharge Covers: Hinged discharge covers are easy to open and close. Latch the cover open when unloading. During the off-season, you can close and latch the cover shut to prevent snow or rodents from entering the unload. Rack-and-Pinion Gates: All sumps are covered with rack-and-pinion gates that are fixed with roller bearings for easy opening and closing. Independent Next-to-Center Sump: A next-to-center sump that opens independently from the other intermediate sumps can be opened if the center sump becomes plugged. Double Flighting: Double flighting in the center sump increases unload capacity. 16:1 Gear Reduction: An aggressive 16:1 gear reduction wheel propels the sweep into the grain mass for faster and easier unloads.

Unstiffened hopper bins come standard with an 8,000lb peak roof load. Roof Ribs: 3-1/2-inch-deep rigidized roof ribs are locked to the roof wind ring, so the roof acts as a single, dynamic unit. Corrugation: The flat portion of the roof panel is corrugated for additional strength and finished with a formed drip edge. Roof Vents: Pre-punched 20-by-20-inch roof vents are made from a high-molecular-weight polyethylene that is injected with a U.V. inhibitor prior to fabrication. A 1-inch tall ridge surrounding the vent hole prevents moisture from entering the bin. Continuous Eave Angle: The continuous eave angle spreads the roof load evenly onto the sidewall sheets. Bird Clips: Push-up bird clips on eave angles minimize parts and labor. Wind Rings: Individual pipe sections are clamped and fastened to the roof with a locking bracket at every rib. This adds security and durability by eliminating twisting and displacement. Formed Peak Ring: Superior’s formed peak ring has three breaks instead of one to resist deformation. The roof panel rests on the peak ring and is pressed into a foam closure to seal it against wind-driven snow or rain. EXTERIOR ACCESS Roof Ladder Package: A roof ladder is standard on all Superior bins. For additional safety, add an optional roof ladder handrail package. Remote Opener: (Standard) A ground control remote opener is standard on all hopper bins. Exterior Ladder: (Optional) An exterior ladder is optional on all hopper bins. STRENGTH Grade 50 Steel: Superior bins use Grade 50 steel that has a tensile strength up to 65,000 psi. G-90 Bright Galvanization: A G-90 bright galvanized steel coating provides enduring protection against the elements. JS500 Grade 8.2 Bolts: All bins come standard with JS500 grade 8.2 bolts, which are seven times more resistant for exceptional protection compared to standard galvanized bolts. 3/8-inch Bolts: Superior uses 3/8-inch bolts on all hopper bin sidewall sheets, making the bin easier to erect and stronger than the competition.

Our mixed-flow grain dryers deliver even heating while using half the energy of conventional screen dryers. Larger capacities and longer retention times process grains more evenly and significantly reduce the potential for heat stress cracking, resulting in higher quality grains, higher test weights and higher prices for your grain. Superior Grain Dryers are available in capacities ranging from 690 bushels to 9510 bushels. Get dramatic cost savings and superior grain conditioning with Excel. Watch Mixed-Flow Dryer Video View Grain Dryer Warranty View Capacity Info Request a Quote Superior dryer features for superior grain quality. MIXED-FLOW DESIGN Kernel Temperature: The key to preserving grain quality is maintaining optimal temperature throughout the grain dryer. Our mixed-flow process pushes heat up through alternating rows of ducts. This conditions grain from both sides and keeps all seeds the same temperature throughout the process. Consistent, gentle heat ensures that no kernel will be left too moist or over-dried. Retention Time: With their industry-leading holding capacities, Superior dryers retain grain longer while maintaining a high rate of bushels per hour. Combined with consistent dryer temperature, longer retention time provides optimal heat transfer into the seeds’ cores and removes moisture without damaging kernels. QUALITY PROCESS, QUALITY GRAIN Adjustable Burner Transition: The dryer’s true burner transition can be opened or closed at the top to adjust airflow, eliminate hot or cold spots and ensure consistent temperature throughout the dryer. Corner Venting: Superior grain dryers feature the largest corner venting in the industry. The true corner venting at the end of each column allows air to flow properly and prevents hot spots from forming in the dryer’s corners, which could cause the grain to overheat. Drag Chain Conveyers: Grain that is still hot from drying is more susceptible to damage. Drag chain conveyers with durable, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene paddles are gentler on recently conditioned grain than augers. They cause less breakage and cracking, which means less dockage at the elevator. LOW COST, HIGH EFFICIENCY Internal Vaporizer: The Schedule 80 internal vaporizer is the safest and most efficient in the industry. Its 2-inch line vaporizes the propane over more surface area. The vaporizer is in balanced plenum heat, which vaporizes propane more efficiently than harsh blast heat. Fuel-Efficient Maxon Burner: The high-efficiency, low-emission Maxon burner requires less than a pound of pressure to produce 1 million BTUs per linear foot. It will keep your energy costs low even during high production. Two Vapor Regulators: Two vapor regulators in our dryers ensure correct burner pressure. Superior places a Siemens double-valve body between the primary and secondary regulators. Together they provide step-down pressure and ensure that propane enters the burner at less than 2 psi for maximum propane efficiency. LOW MAINTENANCE, EASY EXPANSION Single-Phase Power or Three-Phase Power: Superior dryers utilize single-phase as well as three-phase power to fit any farm situation. And with capabilities ranging from 735 to 7,500 bushels per hour, they can fit operations of any size, from small family farms to large commercial elevators. Easy Expansion: Superior also designs our dryers for easy expansion so your dryer can grow with your operation. Models start at 10 tiers and can be easily expanded up to 26 tiers onsite. Drop-Door Cleanouts: There’s no need to take any bolts or wing nuts off of the drop-door cleanouts. Instead, you can open them easily by flipping the handle on the over-center cam locks. The cleanouts make cleaning with an air hose easy, and everything can be blown out from top to bottom. The doors also act as an emergency cleanout. Control Panel Temperature Regulator: The control panel contains a heater and cooling fan to regulate the temperature within the panel. It protects the unit from overheating or moisture buildup that could damage the control panel’s components. Panel Circuit Transformer: The panel circuit transformer protects against power surges and feedback. In-Panel Service-Rated Disconnect: With the in-panel service-rated disconnect, you don’t need to install an external disconnect as the main power shutoff. SAFE DRYING, SAFE OPERATION Flame Rod: To detect burner ignition, Superior dryers feature a flame rod rather than UV sensor for more accurate readings. The flame rod converts energy from the pilot flame into an electrical signal, which eliminates the possibility of getting a false positive reading. By comparison, UV detectors can misinterpret reflected sunlight as the pilot flame. This could cause the burner to open, and without an established flame the dryer could fill with flammable propane gas. Liquid Gas Regulator: The liquid gas regulator prevents vapor lock by releasing the correct amount of liquid to the vaporizer. It also prevents the vaporizer from being overloaded with raw propane. This increases safety and saves you money by ensuring you won’t have to bleed excess propane into the air. True Piloted Gas Train: Superior dryers have a true-piloted gas train that automatically shuts off after the burner is lit. If the main flame goes out, the pilot won’t reignite, and the dryer won’t fill with gas. EASY OPERATION, TOTAL CONTROL DM510: You’ll get even more detailed drying information and control with the Dryer Master DM510. The add-on panel reduces over- and under-drying, increases throughput and reduces energy use. The system monitors inlet and outlet moisture, drying temperature and discharge rate, and automatically adjusts dryer speed to reach the target discharge moisture level. An LCD display shows moisture and temperature settings. You also can choose to make your own adjustments in manual mode. You can print a summary of moisture readings from the day, as well as other data stored in a memory module. The DM510 also features DM-mobile so you can access drying information from a tablet, PC or smart phone. Superior can also customize a control panel so you can electronically monitor any aspect of the dryer or drying process. Additional information can be found at www.dryermaster.com. EASY IN, EASY OUT Gravity Fill: A gravity fill is standard on all models. With no motor and no moving parts, it is an efficient, low-maintenance filling solution. Scalper: If height is a restriction, Superior’s scalper is a low-profile filling option. The scalper is filled from one side and a drag chain conveyer carries grain across the top of the dryer to fill it evenly. 2-to-1 Transition: The 2-to-1 gravity transition comes standard on Superior grain dryers. Two drag chain conveyers, one on each side of the dryer, carry the conditioned grain from the bottom of the dryer toward the unloading point. The 2-to-1 gravity transition connects to both conveyers and gently funnels the grain to one unloading point. Cross-Drag Conveyer: The cross-drag conveyer connects to the dryer’s two drag chain conveyers and carries conditioned grain away from the dryer for storage or transportation. It is available in 14-, 19-, 24- and 29-foot lengths. Catwalk: A 33-inch-wide catwalk that covers one side of the top of the dryer is standard. It extends the length of the dryer to 16, 24, 32, 40 or 48 feet. The end platforms are 30 inches deep and run the full 8-foot width of the dryer. Wrap-Around Platforms: (Optional) Wrap-around platforms cover the entire top of the dryer and provide 360-degree access to the scalper or gravity fill. Side Platforms: (Optional) Superior also offers optional side platforms that are 33 inches wide and extend the length of the dryer. You’ll be able to see grain movement inside the process area from the side platforms.

Because it’s made of a high-molecular-weight poly material, it is completely UV resistant and will never rust. Vent holes are pre-punched with a gentle 3-inch corner radius to prevent sheet tearing. A 1-inch tall ridge surrounding the vent hole prevents moisture from entering the bin.

The bolt-together galvanized construction eliminates platform failure, rust formation or the chance of welds cracking. CATWALKS Strength, durability and portability – Superior catwalks have it all. We’ve incorporated a 42-inch handrail into the truss design so they can carry heavier loads and span greater distances. The heavy-duty steel members will last for years, and since they’re galvanized, they won’t rust. And with our all-bolt design, they’re easy to transport anywhere in the world and simple to assemble on-site.

The bin site should be firm, level and well-drained to prevent water from collecting near the bin. A soil analysis needs to be completed by a qualified soil engineer to determine the soil bearing capacity of the site. SITE PLAN Once you have selected your site and determined that the soil has adequate soil bearing capacity, it is important to complete a site plan. The complexity of the site plan is dependent on the size and number of bins to be assembled. The site plan should address the following (where applicable). Clearly identify all bin locations Mark the locations of all standard and optional accessories such as doors, fans, stairs, ladders, vents, and inspection hatches. Determine where the loading/unloading equipment will be positioned. Be sure to allow enough space for easy loading and unloading as well as room for future expansion. Clearly identify any trees or electrical hazards (power lines, transmission equipment, etc.) Ensure that adequate power is available to the site for operation of any aeration or unload equipment and identify its location on the plan. FOUNDATION PREPARATION The following are general guidelines for preparing the bin foundation. Site and soil conditions, and local code and jurisdiction requirements may create foundation requirements not covered in this section. A qualified geotechnical engineer should review all foundation specifications, including anchor bolts. This review is needed to assure that the foundation design is compatible with the maximum load bearing capacity of the soil and any other environmental factors concerning the bin location. A minimum soil bearing capacity of 4,000 pounds per square foot is required for Superior bins. Determine the diameter of the fill placement for your bin size. See example below. Fill placement = Bin Diameter – 2 feet. Example: 42′ bin – 2 feet = 40 feet The diameter of fill placement for a 42′ bin is 40 feet. Drive a small pipe into the ground to mark the center of the foundation. Using the pipe as a pivot point, use a board or a sharp stake attached to the outer end of a chain to mark the diameter of the foundation. Level your site. Place fill on level site. See Table 3 for concrete and fill specifications. Additional fill should be close by. Knock down, level, and compact fill within bin radius. Bin Site Specifications BIN SIZE Est.
