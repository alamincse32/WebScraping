No other specialized trailer has the integrity a Trail King does. If your heavy specialized carrier shows up with anything other than a Trail King they are simply ill prepared for the job. - Frontier Specialized Heavy Transport Trail King wrote the book on customer service!! My experience was the best with Brian Hofer, he went well beyond customer service and provided an experience unmatched by most. I will always recommend Trail King and their Director of Customer Service for future opportunities. - Samuel Skierski Only trailer I’ve ever owned that I haven’t been afraid to push to its limits. Quality built with minimal if any down time. - Ben Bruinius Love my stepdeck! It’s light but built heavy duty!! - Jamie Donaldson Trail King has a great product and my first pick for a Heavy Haul trailer. - James West Out of all the trailers I’ve pulled I find trail king is the most user friendly. And in my opinion they build the best trailers in the industry. - Michael Renner I’m proud to own this piece of equipment and can’t tell you how much difference it makes using equipment that is perfectly tailored for the job I do.

16,"Our History | Trail King Industries 800-843-3324 Solutions Agriculture Materials Hauling Open Deck Commercial Open Deck Construction Specialized Tagalong Services Parts Refurb & Service Warranty & Technical Assistance Paint Process Find A Rep Our Company Our Why Our History News & Events Brand Assets Official Trail King Merchandise Government Contracts Careers Workforce Recruitment Program Employment Opportunities Apply Now Contact Us Customer Survey Get Financing Contact Finance Dealer Portal Our History 1974 Gordon and Shirley Thomsen founded Western Ag Sales in 1974. During the first few years, the company was primarily a distributor and sales representative for manufacturers of agricultural equipment. 1978 In 1978, Western Ag Sales purchased another Mitchell-based manufacturing company, Plains Industries, and moved into their manufacturing facility. With this purchase, Western Ag also brought a new line into their product offerings called “Trail King.” During the next few years, Western Ag expanded this line to include trailers with many enhanced features to better meet customers' specific hauling needs, such as hydraulic tails and detachable goosenecks. The most notable feature was Trail King's development of what many at the time considered the best hydraulic detachable gooseneck in the industry: a system that made hooking up and unhooking a simple, one-person ""60-second connection."" As the 1970's ended, the company's emphasis shifted away from the distribution of ag-related equipment to focus exclusively on manufacturing Trail King trailers. 1983 Western Ag Sales officially changed its name to Trail King Industries in 1983. This focus on trailers led to an expanded product line. These trailers were designed to address construction-related applications and to meet the needs of the commercial and specialized hauling markets. Along with this product line expansion came increased sales, which naturally lead to increased production capability demands. To address this need, Trail King built a new manufacturing plant in 1987. This new 67,500 square-foot plant helped meet the ever-increasing demand for Trail King trailers. 1995 The plant was expanded in 1992 when sales continued to grow, straining production capacity. Two years later, it was expanded again after Trail King acquired assets of Ti-Brook, Inc. Today, our facilities in Mitchell stand at 295,000 square feet. They provide state-of-the-art production capabilities for a workforce of over 450 employees. 2000 In 2000, Trail King further expanded their product offerings after purchasing Red River Manufacturing based in West Fargo, ND. Red River had a well-deserved reputation for manufacturing outstanding live bottom and bottom dump trailers for the agricultural, waste, and construction industries. With the 2007 construction of a brand new 160,000-square-foot facility, it further increased Trail King's ability to meet market demand in an even more timely, efficient, and quality manner. 2010 Trail King was acquired by CC Industries, Inc (CCI) in 2010. This acquisition expanded CCI's portfolio of leading industrial manufacturers and transportation equipment companies. It also afforded Trail King the expertise and support necessary to enhance Trail King's long-term strategic growth as North America's leading specialized trailer manufacturer. 2015 In May 2015, Trail King expanded its product offerings and its production capacity when they acquired Dakota Trailer Manufacturing located in Yankton, SD. Dakota Trailers produced aluminum grain hopper trailers for the agriculture market. These trailers have complemented Trail King's existing line of live bottom agriculture trailers that are manufactured at its West Fargo facility. 2021 In March 2019, our plant in West Fargo sustained irreparable damage due to a collapsed roof after a massive snowstorm. The decision was made to fast forward a plan to expand and improve the property. A new building was finished in the summer of 2021. 2022 Despite our growth and change—and all that surely lies in our future—we will continue to hold the same values and mission. We will always strive to lead the way in the trailer industry, delivering trailers that are engineered and manufactured to the highest standards of quality, performance, and reliability.

Contact our marketing team. Thank you for your interest in Trail King Industries. Contact Us! TRAIL KING BRAND RESOURCES These guidelines are for anyone who wants to use Trail King’s brand assets in their marketing or advertising and briefly covers guidelines for the assets approved use. Consistent use of these assets helps people easily recognize references to Trail King and protects company trademarks. It is important that your marketing materials use Trail King standards and approved assets correctly. LOGOS CROWN LOGO The Trail King crown is our sigil, the main identifier of our brand. Trail King uses only three versions of the crown logo - full color metallic, black, and white. Do not attempt to recreate the logo or alter the provided files. Always size proportionally, but never size the crown so small that it is no longer legible. Avoid stylizing the logo with drop shadows or other effects. Do not change the color of the logo or present the logo with any opacity. Do not place our crown over the focus of the graphic. Download approved logo. LOGOTYPE The Trail King logotype is used in design scenarios in which the crown logo is not ideal. Trail King takes liberty to use the logotype with or without the crown identifier, depending upon the situation. Only white or black versions of the logotype are permitted for use. As with all of our logos, proper spacing around the logo is essential. Download approved logo. Please DO ensure the logo has plenty of space around it Please DO size proportionally Please DO contact our team if you have any questions Please DON'T alter these files in any way Please DON'T change the color of the logo Please DON'T use a light logo on a light background Please DON'T adjust the opacity Please DON'T place the logo over the focus of the graphic OUR COLORS Trail King’s color palette is simple and timeless- white, black, and grey. The “grey” color is very specific to our brand and the guidelines do not allow for other shades. TRIANGLES The registered Trail King triangles are the easiest way to identify a Trail King trailer on the road. Most often, the triangles are used in the format of the ibeam, commonly used as a divider in graphic designs. The ibeam graphic should be scaled proportionally, not too small, or too large. Trail King also uses the triangles without the beam, but they should always be used in groups of 6 or more, and they should never be grouped vertically. These graphics are proprietary and protected under intellectual property laws. Gov Contracts Cooperative purchasing, competitively solicited contracts.
