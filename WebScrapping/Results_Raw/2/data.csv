It’s a total win-win, and I am honored to be able to work with ByteSpeed over the years.”– Rob DeMeuse, Mauston School District, Mauston, WIRead Other Lovenotes“Without a doubt, ByteSpeed support is #1. While we purchase only ByteSpeed servers in our district now, we have purchased servers from other companies in the past. As important as price is, they consistently give us a great deal on servers. If we run into any issues at all, their support team is quick to respond and are always able to resolve the problem for us. Getting price quotes is so painless with ByteSpeed. I ask for a quote and I receive it quickly without being hassled or pressured into purchasing. ByteSpeed is an all-around fantastic company to work with!”– Chuck Whiteley IIIIT Manager, Central Point School District 6, OregonRead Other Lovenotes“Channelview ISD has been working with ByteSpeed for several years. After dealing with headaches from other vendors for years, we tested one of their NUCs out and were impressed by its performance, especially at that price. Then we heard about the 5 year desktop warranty and were sold. Since then, we purchase all ByteSpeed NUCs for our teacher and student desktops and plan to continue that in the future. ByteSpeed not only delivers on hardware and variety, but their customer service is top notch. You get a real live person on the phone when you call and we have developed relationships with several people there, which is often missing in other vendors. ByteSpeed, along with the NUCs, has helped us to be able to regularly replace machines to keep students and teachers up to date with their equipment and we couldn’t be happier about it.”– Darrell Cheney, Director of Technology, Channelview ISD, Channelview, TXRead Other Lovenotes“We made the decision to go with ByteSpeed because I really enjoy working with your company and you will bend over backwards to help us and make sure we are happy with our purchase! So thank you!”– Angie Aaseth, NRHEG Technology Coordinator, NRHEG School District, New Richland, MNRead Other Lovenotes“We’ve been with ByteSpeed for many years, and could not possibly be happier. ByteSpeed sells high quality products that have performed admirably for us. Also, their support and customer service is truly outstanding. Their staff is always helpful, knowledgeable, and courteous, which means a lot to us. As a Technology Coordinator for a school district, I can say that their 5-year desktop warranty on PCs is not the norm for the computer industry, but it sure makes my job a lot easier. We are very satisfied with our relationship with ByteSpeed. I highly recommend them, and give them the highest rating possible!”– Dusty Malena, Technology Coordinator, Booneville School District, Booneville, ARRead Other Lovenotes“I have been working with ByteSpeed since 2008. They have wonderful technical support and customer service. If you have a question they will help out in any way they can to resolve the problem. If you are looking for any kind of equipment and ByteSpeed may not carry what you are looking for, email and ask them. They have a wonderful sales team and will go and look for what you need and get you the best price. I will be using ByteSpeed for a very long time.”– Jory Schmidt, Technology Coordinator, Highmore-Harrold School District, Highmore, SDRead Other Lovenotes“ByteSpeed’s custom bulk packaging option is spectacular! Not only is there less waste, but it is much easier to get to the equipment. We would rather have that type of packaging for all my orders. Thanks so much!”– Tess Hill, Technology Coordinator, Switzerland of Ohio School District, Woodsfield, OHRead Other Lovenotes“I am just truly impressed with the great service and support we get from the folks at ByteSpeed.

We could never have gotten that great of customer service, creative customization options, or help with creating team jerseys from a big chain company.”– Chris HokeUniversity of Jamestown EsportsRead Other Lovenotes“Over the last 10+ years, our district has built a great partnership with ByteSpeed/Gravity Gaming. We purchased multiple gaming PCs with VR headsets for our high school STEM lab, which also enabled us to start an esports club. We look forward to working with the great staff at ByteSpeed/Gravity gaming to purchase other gaming items for our esports team.”– Chris KuntzmanTaylorville CUSD #3, Taylorville, ILRead Other LovenotesESPORTS CASE STUDIESClick the images below to enlarge the case studies ESPORTS FAQHow many PCs does it take to start an esports team?The games you are playing and the minimum required seats for a starting lineup: Rocket League would be 3, League of Legends and many other titles have 5, and Overwatch 2 has 5 players. You may want to consider doubling that number to have a “Varsity” and “JV” lineup for each title so they can practice against each other in scrimmages during practice.Should I look at desktops or laptops for my esports team?This really will depend on two factors. First, what are the available spaces for your programs facility? If you do not have a permanent area for desktops to be housed, laptops give you the flexibility to move from space to space, or to store the machines during off hours for the program and free up the space for different uses during the day. The second factor is if your team travels or plans to travel frequently to LAN tournaments. “Bring your own computer” style events still happen, and if your team plans to be on the road often, laptops might be a better fit. A desktop, however, will have more options for parts – both at the time of purchase and later if you wish to upgrade or update.ESPORTS IN EDUCATIONGRAVITY GAMING BY BYTESPEEDByteSpeed: Your Complete IT ResourcePHONE(877) 553-0777ADDRESS3131 24th Avenue SouthMoorhead, MN 56560EMAILsales@bytespeed.comFOLLOW BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowFOLLOW GRAVITY GAMING BY BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowABOUT USByteSpeed has been a leading IT solutions resource since 1999.

Cold redundancy means one power supply is in an efficient low-power state, and it is not activated until it is needed.What is happening when I see a blinking green System Status LED?It could be one of the following:The system has just had AC power applied.The system is operating in a redundant state but with an impending failure. For example, two redundant power supplies are installed, but one has failed, is unplugged or is predicted to fail.The system is in a Degraded state. The system is still functional, but a non-critical temperature or voltage issue has occurred.Memory configured as RAS has failed.Memory is transitioning to a warning state.Why are my fans running at high speed?Ensure that:The power supply is firmly set into the power supply bay.The connector to the power supply is secure.The power cords are properly attached to the AC outlet.In case of using pedestal chassis, make sure the top cover is properly seated.Is the temperature of the room warm/hot? The fans will automatically adjust speed to cool down the hardware as needed.Try powering down and then powering back on the server fully. A power fluctuation/surge could have tripped the fans into an error state.Does it really matter what kind of UPS I use with my servers?YES! Do not use a “simulated” or “Stepped approximation to a sinewave” UPS. Verify that the UPS is a “pure” or “true” sinewave model. Use of simulated sinewave UPS’ will result in entries in the error log, excessive fan noise (from being in an error state) and potentially damage the server’s power supplies.Can you provide me with the latest firmware or drivers for my server?Yes.

Request a Free TrialappstreamFAQWhich plan should I pick?The answer depends on how you plan to use it – whether you need it only for supplemental/snow days or as a lab replacement. Predictable Economy offers a static number of seats available throughout the day while Scalable Performance lets you increase the number of seats available for scheduled classes. Define Supplemental Usage?When designing our supplemental usage environment, we took averages from our current school adoptions and built it out for 10 percent of the students to be actively using the applications at any time. We do understand that at times that could be less or more and have scaling policies in place to increase capacity as the number of people in the environment gets close to that 10 percent mark. It will be important for schools to connect with ByteSpeed right away to let us know if there are snow days or major lab issues that will require heavier usage for a certain amount of time so that we can ensure the best possible user experience.What if I don’t see a plan that would work for our school? Can you customize another plan?Yes. Please connect with ByteSpeed for options.What applications are available?AutodeskAdobeOffice 365PLTWAutoCad 2021PhotoshopWord RobotCRevit 2021Illustrator 2020ExcelGreenfootFusion 360DreamweaverPowerPointFlowArmInventor Pro 2021InDesignAccessWestPoint BridgeDesignerLightroom ClassicPublisherGraphical Analysis 4Acrobat DCLogger Pro 3Premier ProAmerica’s Army SimulationAfter EffectsMD Solids VEXcode V5Does this solution cover the cost of the software? Do I need to provide my own licensing?This solution does not include the software. Schools are required to own the licenses for the software that is used the CLaaS environment. For example, Adobe CC requires the school to have Adobe ID cloud accounts setup, while Microsoft Office requires the school to have the appropriate Office 365 license(A1 Plus or A3, Autodesk requires license server files.)What if applications we use are not on the list?Minor software tweaks or additional software may be considered. If you are looking for a custom environment that is far outside of our scope of work, we may refer you to one of our partners who build custom AWS environments.How do my students save files?When ByteSpeed sets up each school, we attach cloud storage to your AppStream environment. Schools can choose between either OneDrive or Google Drive and users will have the ability to save and open files/projects from their individual user accounts. ByteSpeed will take care of this during the initial setup. Google Drivehttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/google-drive-end-user.htmlOneDrivehttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/onedrive-end-user.htmlHow customizable is the user experience?Each school will have a custom branded landing page that will include school logos and links. Why is there a 100 user minimum?There are fixed costs and maintenance within the AWS environment that don’t allow for a per student model that covers less than 100 students.Who qualifies as a user?Anyone who has access to AppStream, including students, teachers, and technology team.How do I determine how many users I need to pay for/license?The best way is to work with the teachers and cross-reference with the classes in your SIS site to get a count of how many students are enrolled in those classes. Don’t forget to include the teachers and anyone else you want to have access to AppStream.What if my user count changes throughout the year (for example, a user is taking a course for only one semester)?Every user that will be accessing an application throughout the school year will need to be counted whether they are using the applications during one semester or two.What does the annual maintenance fee cover?ByteSpeed is responsible for creation and maintenance of the following as well as managing usage to provide a sustainable pricing model.Amazon Web Services accounts are created under ByteSpeed’s organizationVPC which includes the subnets, routing tables, NAT and Internet Gateways, security policies, users and rolesServer instances for licensing and internet proxyAppStream Service which includes:Building the main image to be used for the accountSAML authentication integration (Google or Azure with schools help)S3 storage bucketsStorage integration for Google Drive or OnedriveStack and Fleet setupScaling policies for availabilityWhat is our school responsible for?End-user training.How to access the applicationHow to connect your storageHow to properly end an AppStream sessionOn-boarding steps completion with ByteSpeedSetting up appropriate licensing with software vendorsCommunicating dates where AppStream is not needed(long breaks)What time frame does an annual subscription include?This plan is built on a traditional school year (36 weeks), which does not include summer school. However, supplemental hours can be purchased to cover summer courses. What hours are included in usage?Both environments are built on a standard school year of 36 weeks with an assumed 8 hour standard school day, 5 hours for homework, 8 hours on the weekends (at reduced capacity). How many users can use AppStream at one time?For the Predictable Economy plan, the environment is built with 10% of the users purchased available. Should usage get close to the 10% number, the environment is built to slowly scale and add seats. *This would make for a very poor user experience if you were operating the solution as a lab replacement. Please note about snow days and lab issues to ensure the best possible experience. We utilize Auto Scaling to add capacity so depending on how fast the student usage turnover is, there may be a wait for them to get into AppStream.For the Scheduled Performance plan, user capacity is built around the class schedule provided by the school with an additional 10 percent buffer to accommodate any outliers. ByteSpeed is committed to the best possible user experience while still maintaining an affordable option for schools. We will work closely with each school in the CLaaS environment to ensure their users have a good user experience.What if I want to change plans during the school year?Reach out to your ByteSpeed Territory Manager and we would be happy to help.How do I make sure my class is available for snow day or broken lab?If you are using the lab replacement option, you should already be ready to go. If you are using the supplement option, Bytespeed would get your schedule and build availability sound your needs with an additional 10% supplemental usage built in. Snow days or lab issues can be communicated to cloudsupport@bytespeed.comHow long does it take to get set up and begin using the software?General rule of thumb is a week. Setup can actually be done in days depending on the software setup.Does this plan auto-renew annually?NoWhat kind of devices does appstream work with?Any device with a modern browser – iPad, Chromebook, Windows, Mac. Depending on the application, having a mouse and keyboard to use with the device may make for a much better user experience.Are trials available?We do have a demo account that we can get you access to. Please request the demo from your Account Manager or sales@bytespeed.com and will schedule time and get you the links needed. What if I want to try this out in the middle of the school year?If you would like to purchase during the middle of the school year, work with your ByteSpeed Territory Manager to discuss options. Usage can also be purchased in hour bundles to cover smaller time frames.How secure is this solution/what security options are included?AppStream offers an application only view. There is no desktop that the students are able to get to, no need to set up group policies or worry about opening other applications. Each session is a sandbox off a master image. After a session is ended the instance is destroyed.Only users who you’ve given access to through GSuite/Azure will have access to AppStream.How do you protect users from browsing the internet?All traffic is routed through a deny all squid proxy with a whitelist of domains only required to run the software.What if I’m using other AWS services?This is a separate account created for Appstream and it will not affect anything else being done in a school’s AWS environment.Do you have more information on AppStream 2.0?ByteSpeed’s CLaaS solution is built using Amazon AppStream 2.0.

Not only is there less waste, but it is much easier to get to the equipment. We would rather have that type of packaging for all my orders. Thanks so much!”Tess Hill, Technology Coordinator Switzerland of Ohio School District, Woodsfield, OHRead Other Lovenotes“ByteSpeed has rarely led me astray. From NUCs and mini PCs all the way up to enterprise-grade servers, it’s the brand about which we are most likely to say, “Oh yeah, that’s still running.” As an IT director, there’s no higher compliment I can give.”Matt Bartenhagen, Director of Technical OperationsWilliston Public School District #1Read Other Lovenotes“Channelview ISD has been working with ByteSpeed for many years. After dealing with headaches from other vendors for years, we tested one of their NUCs out and were impressed by its performance, especially at that price. Then we heard about the 5-year desktop warranty and were sold. ByteSpeed not only delivers on hardware and variety, but their customer service is top notch. You get a real live person on the phone when you call. We have developed relationships with several people there, which is often missing in other vendors. ByteSpeed, along with the NUCs, has helped us to be able to regularly replace machines to keep students and teachers up to date with their equipment and we couldn’t be happier about it.”Darrell Cheney, Director of Technology Channelview ISD, Channelview, TXRead Other Lovenotes“Our school district uses ByteSpeed products exclusively and will continue to work with them.

Not only is there less waste, but it is much easier to get to the equipment. We would rather have that type of packaging for all my orders. Thanks so much!”Tess Hill, Technology Coordinator Switzerland of Ohio School District, Woodsfield, OHRead Other Lovenotes“ByteSpeed has rarely led me astray. From NUCs and mini PCs all the way up to enterprise-grade servers, it’s the brand about which we are most likely to say, “Oh yeah, that’s still running.” As an IT director, there’s no higher compliment I can give.”Matt Bartenhagen, Director of Technical OperationsWilliston Public School District #1Read Other Lovenotes“Channelview ISD has been working with ByteSpeed for many years. After dealing with headaches from other vendors for years, we tested one of their NUCs out and were impressed by its performance, especially at that price. Then we heard about the 5-year desktop warranty and were sold. ByteSpeed not only delivers on hardware and variety, but their customer service is top notch. You get a real live person on the phone when you call. We have developed relationships with several people there, which is often missing in other vendors. ByteSpeed, along with the NUCs, has helped us to be able to regularly replace machines to keep students and teachers up to date with their equipment and we couldn’t be happier about it.”Darrell Cheney, Director of Technology Channelview ISD, Channelview, TXRead Other Lovenotes“Our school district uses ByteSpeed products exclusively and will continue to work with them. Their products, support, and service are second to none. Customers are treated as the priority, and with a superior product, using ByteSpeed for our computing needs is a no-brainer!”Marty Petrosky, Technology Director Shanksville StonyCreek School District, Friedens, PARead Other LovenotesOPTOMAFAQWhat is aspect ratio?Aspect ratio describes the width to height relationship of an image. The width and height are measured in equally sized units and are most commonly expressed by two numbers separated by a colon (i.e. 16:9, 16:10, 4:3). So, for example, a 16:9 image that is 16 inches in width, would be 9 inches in height. For more on resolution and aspect ratio, see Optoma’s blog: http://blog.optomausa.com/post/aspect-ratios-and-native-resolutionsWhen would I need to use either a Short or Long Throw Lens?Short throw lenses help create larger pictures from shorter distances — allowing users to create the big pictures they want, in tight spaces. Short throw lenses are commonly used in such environments as small conference rooms, small classrooms, trade show booths, and small home theaters. Long throw lenses help create smaller, more viewable images from greater distances, and are advantageous in large venues, particularly in fixed installations. Churches often require long throw lenses for worship spaces, because the projector is often mounted far away from the screen (e.g., behind the congregation). Without a long throw lens, the image would be too large.You can calculate the throw distance needed by a projector by taking the throw ratio and multiplying it by the screen width. For example a projector with a 2.0 throw ratio needs to be set up with the lens 200 inches from a 100″ wide screen (Throw ratio x screen width) = (2.0 x 100″)What is the difference between maximum resolution and native resolution?Maximum resolution is the highest resolution the projector can scale to. Native resolution is the resolution the projector can display mapping 1 to 1 pixels to the digital micro display chip, sometimes known as pure resolution.

With prices rising and decreased support, the time has come to cut the cord. Get ahead of the shutdown by switching to POTS over LTE/5G solutions that deliver immediate cost savings and productivity enhancements. This includes migrating POTS lines supporting fire and security systems, elevators, fax machines, ATMs, point of sale, security gate door access, and more.

All communication data is sent over an IP network instead of telephone lines, which means organizations can simply use the existing business internet to power connected systems at little to no extra cost.With one of Cradlepoint’s LTE-enabled bridge adapters or branch routers connected to a primary router via the Ethernet and console ports, enterprises can utilize cloud-based OOBM, eliminating the need for POTS lines. When a primary router fails, IT professionals can troubleshoot the problem remotely through cloud access to the command-line interface (CLI). It’s a secure solution that doesn’t require in-bound secure shell (SSH) or publicly routable static IP addresses that are susceptible to cyberattacks.Escape Physical LimitationsAn LTE connection is not limited to a single physical space. This provides businesses connection through their cell phone, eliminating the physical limitations of a landline. IoT IntegrationThe LTE connection can integrate with many other IoT and also has the capacity to transcribe voicemails and have them sent to employee’s inboxes, increasing productivity.Business ContinuityIt is important to have failover internet in place to provide business continuity. Additionally, call forwarding can be implemented as a solution.

Say goodbye to the past and hello to ByteSpeed’s POTS Line Replacement Solution!Out with the Old: The POTS Line SunsetThe era of Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines is drawing to a close. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued an order in August 2019, setting a deadline for replacing all U.S. POTS lines with alternative services by August 2, 2022 meaning telephone companies, like AT&T, Verizon, & other resellers are no longer obligated to service traditional analog landlines. With rising costs and dwindling support, it’s time to make the switch. Protect your business against losing connectivity for critical applications like internet, fire and security alarms, elevators, and more. Switch to ByteSpeed’s POTS over 5G/LTE solution for cost savings and boosted productivity!Why Choose ByteSpeed’s 5G/LTE Solution?ByteSpeed, a trusted name in technology innovation, is at the forefront of providing cutting-edge POTS line replacement options. Here’s why ByteSpeed’s solution deserves your attention:Cost-Efficiency: POTS line expenses can be unpredictable with many providers increasing the cost of landline service to incentivize customers to convert to newer and less expensive technology. ByteSpeed offers a cost-effective alternative with transparent pricing, helping you manage your budget effectively.Critical System Support: Whether you rely on POTS lines for fire and security alarms, elevators, fax machines, ATMs, or point-of-sale systems, ByteSpeed’s solution guarantees uninterrupted connectivity for these vital applications.Performance Beyond Limited Wired Networks: An LTE connection is not limited to a single physical space. This provides a business day one connectivity through wireless solutions, eliminating the physical constraints and unreliability of a landline.Enhance Productivity with IoT Integration: The LTE connection can integrate with many IoT endpoints and has the capacity to provide visibility via notifications to midgait the loss of production on critical assets, therefor increasing productivity.Seamless Transition: ByteSpeed understands the challenges of change. Our expert team will guide you through a smooth transition, minimizing disruptions to your business operations.What the FCC Has to SayThe FCC acknowledges the necessity of this transition. In Section I.3 of the FCC order (19-72A1), it’s stated: “Rather than a foothold for new entrants into the marketplace, [POTS lines] have become a vice, trapping incumbent LECs into preserving outdated technologies and services at the cost of a slower transition to next-generation networks and services that benefit American consumers and businesses.”Make the Switch TodayThe countdown is on, and the time to transition away from POTS lines is now. Delaying this change could result in higher costs and disruptions to your communication infrastructure. ByteSpeed’s POTS Line Replacement Solution offers a seamless path to a more efficient, cost-effective communication future.Contact us today or request a free consultation to learn more: https://bytespeed.com/product/pots-replacement/Search Our Website Search for: Our ProductsCaching and StorageDesktop ComputersEsports PeripheralsGravity GamingMicrosoft Windows 10 Esports SolutionsIndoor Ruckus APIntel NUCInteractive Flat PanelsLaptopsLenovoMicrosoft SurfaceNAECAD ScholarshipsNetworking SolutionsOptomaPrometheanRuckus Outdoor APSamsung StorageServersSpectrumUncategorizedVape DetectionVirtual RealityWorkstationsLatest Blog Posts ByteSpeed E-Rate Guide 2023/2024 Value H610M 2.0 APOLLO B760M APOLLO B660M Solstice MK3 B760MArchivesNovember 2023September 2023July 2023June 2023March 2023February 2023January 2023September 2022July 2022June 2022May 2022April 2022March 2022February 2022December 2021November 2021October 2021September 2021August 2021July 2021June 2021May 2021April 2021March 2021February 2021January 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020June 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018CategoriesApolloArchived DriversBlogCometDesktopDesktopDriversEducationEsportsGravity GamingIntel NUCLaptopLaptopNebulaSolstice MK2Solstice MK3Support Docs – BIOS/FIRMWARESupport Docs – Cloud ServicesSupport Docs – DesktopSupport Docs – General InformationSupport Docs – LaptopSupport Docs – ServersTestimonialsVirtual RealityWorkstationZenithMetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgByteSpeed: Your Complete IT ResourcePHONE(877) 553-0777ADDRESS3131 24th Avenue SouthMoorhead, MN 56560EMAILsales@bytespeed.comFOLLOW BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowFOLLOW GRAVITY GAMING BY BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowABOUT USByteSpeed has been a leading IT solutions resource since 1999.

But have you ever stopped to think how essential it is to protect your passwords, too?That’s where a solution like password managers come in: “a tool that stores one strong master password that gives you easy access to all of your accounts while helping to keep cybercriminals at bay,” explains Norton.Password managers are an effortless way to stay safe online. Not only do they keep all your different passwords organized in one place, some also automatically generate strong, unique passwords that cyberthieves can’t crack.No more changing passwords slightly from account to account or using the dreaded 123456 as your login. These gatekeepers are complex, long, and virtually un-guessable.This primer helps you optimize your password manager to better secure your data.A Relatively New Security InnovationThis is not your grandmother’s code word. Password managers are usually run from an app or piece of computer software that safely houses your usernames and passwords for different sites.Depending on how they’re programmed, randomized passwords may be auto-generated using a lengthy string of letters, numbers, symbols, and capitalization. The main draw is the password manager’s ability to designate unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts. This hub is usually encrypted and guarded with a single password, passphrase, or Touch ID.Password managers may be downloaded as an application, installed as a browser plug-in, or, in some cases, come standard with your device’s operating system. The idea is to automatically capture (and, in some cases, create) a different, complex password and username for every site you log in. To enter the password vault you’ll create a randomized password using the best practices mentioned above – preferably one that’s updated every 90 days.The Pros of a Password ManagerAre you one of the 66% of people who use the same password for multiple accounts? You’re not alone. Because the dozens of different passwords we use can be hard to keep track of, many are happy to let password managers do the work for them.Password manager perks include:1. No more password memorization. Commit just one main password to memory and let your password manager handle the rest.2. Unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts. Usually, these are comprised of at least 12 random characters, including lower and upper case letters, numbers, and symbols.3. Password encryption for added security. Sensitive data, including passwords, personal ID numbers, and credit card information, is encrypted or “scrambled” making it virtually useless to hackers, even if they do somehow crack your code.A Few Things to Keep In MindSo if password managers are so great, why do fewer than 15% of Americans use them?Vulnerability: While password managers are one of the best, most secure solutions available, they’re not completely impenetrable or hack-proof. Most skeptics worry all their passwords could be stolen at once. The good news is that many password managers are encrypted, so even if a breach does occur, the data should be virtually useless to the cybercrook.User error: Forget or misplace your main password and you could be locked out of the rest of the information in your vault.Setup difficulties: There’s also a learning curve associated with password managers. If it’s your first time setting one up, you may need to pull from a database of passwords you previously created, or manually enter them into the vault.Even with their shortcomings, it’s easy to see why password managers are rapidly emerging as an essential component of our digital lives. Their popularity is expected to increase as the number of cyberthreats and accounts we have continue to escalate. No wonder they’ve been endorsed by everyone from The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the vast majority of cyber-security specialists. Like the sound of one password to unlock them all? This is the way to do it – safely.Search Our Website Search for: Our ProductsCaching and StorageDesktop ComputersEsports PeripheralsGravity GamingMicrosoft Windows 10 Esports SolutionsIndoor Ruckus APIntel NUCInteractive Flat PanelsLaptopsLenovoMicrosoft SurfaceNAECAD ScholarshipsNetworking SolutionsOptomaPrometheanRuckus Outdoor APSamsung StorageServersSpectrumUncategorizedVape DetectionVirtual RealityWorkstationsLatest Blog Posts ByteSpeed E-Rate Guide 2023/2024 Value H610M 2.0 APOLLO B760M APOLLO B660M Solstice MK3 B760MArchivesNovember 2023September 2023July 2023June 2023March 2023February 2023January 2023September 2022July 2022June 2022May 2022April 2022March 2022February 2022December 2021November 2021October 2021September 2021August 2021July 2021June 2021May 2021April 2021March 2021February 2021January 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020June 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018CategoriesApolloArchived DriversBlogCometDesktopDesktopDriversEducationEsportsGravity GamingIntel NUCLaptopLaptopNebulaSolstice MK2Solstice MK3Support Docs – BIOS/FIRMWARESupport Docs – Cloud ServicesSupport Docs – DesktopSupport Docs – General InformationSupport Docs – LaptopSupport Docs – ServersTestimonialsVirtual RealityWorkstationZenithMetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgByteSpeed: Your Complete IT ResourcePHONE(877) 553-0777ADDRESS3131 24th Avenue SouthMoorhead, MN 56560EMAILsales@bytespeed.comFOLLOW BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowFOLLOW GRAVITY GAMING BY BYTESPEEDFollowFollowFollowFollowFollowABOUT USByteSpeed has been a leading IT solutions resource since 1999.
