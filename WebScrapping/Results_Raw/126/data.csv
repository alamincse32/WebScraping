We have both. No matter how thick or heavy your metal is, we have the equipment to mold it with expert craftsmanship. At our fabrication shop, we provide: Shearing Sawing Cutting Plate rolling Angle rolling Sheet bending Tube bending Engineering Punching Metal Fabrication From healthcare to energy, every industry needs metals to function. Sheet metal is used universally as the basis for all necessary ideas, and we’re the specialists who bend, stamp, weld, and (for lack of a better word) fabricate the pieces you need for your project. In a nutshell, we’re here to build you up. Custom fabrication isn’t a skill you’re born with—it’s earned with training, hard work, and experience. At Sanders Metal Products, we appreciate the value of great custom metal fabrication more than the average Joe. We’ve been doing it for over 30 years. Engineering Engineering and structural design are two capabilities that help make us a full-service shop. We have 4 engineers on staff to get your ideas down on paper. No matter the size, we turn your loose conceptions into cold, hard, metal that fits whatever you need it for. Our engineers are proficient in CAD and other design programs. Metal Cutting Metal cutting is a required when it comes to fabrication—it’s the practice of shaping metals to use as parts for a whole idea. This can be done a couple different ways, but the most common cutting techniques include shearing and sawing. But, we’re proud to provide our advanced laser, plasma, and waterjet cutting capabilities in addition to shearing and sawing. Laser cutting and waterjet cutting are popular by demand because they’re incredibly accurate. The machines we use can cut through all types of metals, including steels, aluminum, bronze, copper, and more. The power of these machines is incredible, slicing through up to 6 inches of metal at a time. It’s like cutting through butter. We know we can take whatever hunk of metal you throw at us.

Not only do our welders combine metal pieces, but they maintain and operate the machines in our fabrication shop. Our staff is trained to work with all types of metals. Our welders manufacture parts for the oil and gas, construction, agricultural, and many other industries. And they don’t have to be large jobs, either –We’re proud that we offer custom work for individuals that need parts fixed. We’re also proud that we have the manpower and space to work on much larger projects. MIG Welding This type of arc welding is the easiest and fastest since it doesn’t require the welder to do two things at once. MIG welding has a wire electrode that creates the weld instead of separate powder. TIG Welding TIG Welding requires a little more focus, which our welders are trained to handle. Using this welding method requires the welder to place filler materials onto the welds with one hand and operate the torches with the other. Grinding When you need a smooth surface or an invisible weld, let us help. Grinding is an important aspect to make sleek surfaces on metal, and it requires heavy attention to detail to get it right.
