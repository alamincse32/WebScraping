Through the combined efforts of Eberhard Anheuser, Adolphus Busch, and thousands of employees, our brewery quickly transformed from a local fixture into a national presence. Today, we employ thousands of people nationwide, all united by a deep passion for dreaming big and supporting the communities that we call home. 1870s Adolphus Busch, a German immigrant, arrived in the United States in 1857. By 1861, Adolphus had married Lilly Anheuser, the daughter of local businessman Eberhard Anheuser. After serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Adolphus went to work at his father-in-lawâs brewery and begins building a brand that would become an American Icon. 1870s Anheuser-Busch becomes the first American brewery to use pasteurization, allowing beer to be shipped long distances without spoiling. 1870s Anheuser-Buschâs use of new technologies like pasteurization artificial refrigeration, refrigerated railcars, and rail-side ice house allowed Budweiser to become the first nationally distributed beer brand. Today, Budweiser is brewed in 12 locations across the US an at more than 50 breweries around the world. FOR THE LOVE OF LAGER The introduction of lager beer to the United States by German immigrants during the mid-19th century forever changed the landscape of the brewing industry. As lager became the most popular style of beer, we pioneered the use of new technologies allowing consumers across America to enjoy beers like Michelob, Faust, and Budweiser. Our time-honored traditions of brewing the highest quality beer while constantly innovating has pushed the future of our industry forward. The Birth of Lager In the mid-1800s, the population of St. Louis exploded as a large wave of German immigrants settled in the city. One of the principal industries that Germans brought to St. Louis was brewing. These German brewers introduced a style of beer popular in Germany, but relatively unknown in the United States: lager beer. Eberhard Anheuser From Soap to Beer Eberhard Anheuser â a German soap maker who would go on to own the largest soap and candle company in St. Louis â emigrated to Missouri in 1843. Although he had no brewing experience, Eberhard became part owner of the Bavarian and by 1860 had bought out the other investors, changing the breweryâs name to E. Anheuser & Co. Adolphus Busch - A Historic Partnership Adolphus Busch was born in 1839, the second youngest of 22 children. At the age of 18, he made his way to St. Louis via New Orleans and the Mississippi River. Adolphus began working as a clerk on the riverfront and by the time he was 21, he had a partnership in a brewing supply business. It was through this enterprise that Adolphus Busch met Eberhard Anheuser â and his daughter Lilly. A Fortunate Love Story In 1861, Adolphus Busch and Eberhard Anheuserâs daughter Lilly were married. Shortly after that, Adolphus went to work for his father-in-law at E. Anheuser & Co, later purchasing half of the brewery. An Americon Icon is Born Adolphusâ vision and entrepreneurial mindset grew the business both in the US and abroad â no small feat at the time. In 1879, the company was renamed the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association to recognize his efforts. When Eberhard Anheuser died in 1880, Adolphus became president of the brewery. In 1901, the company broke the 1 million barrels of beer sales mark for the first time, making it one of the nationâs leading breweries. Crowning a King When Adolphus began working at the brewery, most beer in the United States was sold and consumed in the community in which it was brewed. But, Adolphus was determined to create a brand that would transcend the tradition of local brews and appeal to people across the US. In 1876, Adolphus and his friend Carl Conrad created Budweiser, an American-style lager that succeeded beyond anyoneâs expectations and eventually became the breweryâs flagship brand: Sales & Marketing Center Stage In addition to being a leader in the technical development of the brewing industry, Adolphus Busch was also a master of advertising and promotion. Adolphus used traditional, proven selling methods, but in a far more organized and deliberate manner than his competitors. He pioneered the use of giveaways and in the 1880s turned the Anheuser-Busch brewery into a tourist destination by offering tours to the public.

Barley: The Soul of Beer Each variation of malted barley delivers a unique taste and aroma. Bready, toasted, caramel-like notes are thoughtfully and precisely blended.ï»¿ Hops: The Spice of Beer These small, bitter, cone-shaped blossoms create fruity, piney, and floral characteristics. By combining different types, we balance the sweet notes and malty weight of each beer. With each hand-selected combination of hops, our brewmasters craft each beer's unique aroma and balanced bitter flavor. Water: Beer's Unsung Hero Making up over 90% of every beer, water can have a massive impact on taste. By adjusting the water's hardness, we float between crisp, refreshing tastes and full, earthy tones. Even the natural minerals in water can âseasonâ the beer by pushing flavors to the forefront. Our brewmasters always filter, test and taste our water before it ever enters the brewing process â ensuring every drop of beer meets our exacting standards. Rice for a crisp clean finish Rice is an extremely high-quality brewing adjunct we use to help lighten the body of many of our beers and give them a subtle sweetness, with a crisp, fast, refreshing finish. Adolphus Busch first added rice to Budweiser to set it apart from other lagers â and today we continue that tradition. In fact, we are the largest end user of rice in the United States and even mill some of our supply at our rice mill in Jonesboro, AR. Yeast: The ""Life"" Of Beer Yeast is a very important and often underestimated contributor to the flavor of beer. Each of our 1,200 different strains of yeast turns sugars into alcohol, triggering unique smells and tastes. They add powerful aromas to our beers â aromas like banana, rose, apple, aniseed, almond, cloves, and even hints of pepper can appear in the final profile.

Featured Initiatives Decide to Ride Responsible Delivery Responsible Drinking Drink Wiser About our Commitment At Anheuser-Busch, sustainability is core to everything we do. Whether it's sourcing high-quality ingredients from US farmers or reducing the environmental impact of our more than 120 facilities nationwide, a healthy environment and thriving local communities are key ingredients in the brewing process.That's why, as America's leading brewer, we aim to make a big impact with a small footprint through our industry-leading sustainability efforts â and inspire our partners, colleagues, and consumers to do the same.We focus our sustainability efforts in four key areas across our supply chain where we can leverage our scale and expertise to drive the most impact from 'seed to sip': sustainable agriculture, water stewardship, renewable electricity and carbon reduction, and circular packaging.In 2018, we set aggressive 2025 goals against these four key pillars. Since then, we have invested millions of dollars in innovative sustainability initiatives, and we are ahead of schedule, including achieving our goal of brewing our products with 100% renewable electricity. Smart Agriculture: 100% of our direct farmers will be highly-skilled, connected, and financially empowered by 2025 Water Stewardship: 100% of our facilities will be engaged in water efficiency efforts; and 100% of our communities in high-stress areas will have measurably improved water availability and quality by 2025 Renewable Energy and Carbon Reduction: 100% of our purchased electricity will come from renewable sources and CO2 emissions across our value chain will be reduced by 25% by 2025 Circular Packaging: 100% of our packaging will be made from majority recycled content or will be returnable by 2025 Yet, we continue to dream big and challenge ourselves to do more. Through our new global ambition to achieve net-zero by 2040, we aim to grow our quality ingredients, brew our beer, and deliver our products in a way that leaves our planet and the communities we serve better than we found them.Our purpose is to create a future with more cheers, which means taking action now to invest in a more sustainable future for our planet that we can celebrate together.
