All Super-Slide products have unique formulas that set them apart from other liners on the market. Only Super-Slide UHMW liners contain 2% silicone to give an even better self-lubricating release. UHMW Yellow Quartz is the highest wearing UHMW liner. In addition, all Super-Slide products are UV stabilized to prevent cracking from extended exposure to the sun. Each product is distinctively colored, Yellow, Red, Blue, and White with a Blue Stripe, to prove you have a one of a kind product. Category: Super-Slide® d Can I haul hot asphalt with Super-Slide® Blue Iron? No. Only Super-Slide Red Hot is rated for hot asphalt. Category: Super-Slide® d Can I haul rip-rap or demolition with my Super-Slide® dump truck bed plastic liner? Rip-rap and demolition are not recommended. However, with care and only under specific conditions, these materials may be hauled on Super-Slide plastic liners. Before loading any material, put a layer of dirt on the liner. Load the rip-rap or demolition very carefully. Immediately, repair any punctures or holes in the liner. Category: Super-Slide® d How do I know which side should face up? Super-Slide Blue Stripe needs to be unrolled and flipped over before installing. No flipping is needed for Super-Slide Red Hot, Blue Iron and Yellow Quartz liners. Category: Super-Slide® d How long does it take to install a Super-Slide® dump truck bed plastic liner? A typical installation takes six to seven hours for two people. With experience, it may take two people as little as four hours. Category: Super-Slide® d How long will a Super-Slide® dump truck bed plastic liner last? The life of the Super-Slide plastic liner depends on the products hauled with it, the number of loads it carries and the condition of your floor. In general, a Red Hot liner will be two times as durable as a steel liner and four times as durable as an aluminum liner. A Blue Iron liner will generally be one time more durable than steel and three times more durable than aluminum. Category: Super-Slide® d How much does Super-Slide® weigh?

Self LubricationWear ResistanceGood Cold Weather PerformanceLow MaintenanceNon-stickImpact ResistanceLightweightWeldableNoise ReductionCorrosion ResistanceMachinableRepairable Category: Super-Slide® d What can I do to extend the life of my dump truck bed plastic liner? Make sure no material has become lodged under the liner. Foreign material caught under the liner creates high spots, which cause faster wear. Also, check to make sure the cover strips are not damaged to restrict the liners expansion. Pressure-wash the liner to keep film and residue from building up on the liner. Check your liner regularly to identify and correct any problems as soon as possible. Category: Super-Slide® d What tools are needed to install a Super-Slide® dump truck bed plastic liner? A list of tools along with instructions and installation tips can be found in the Super-Slide Installation Guide.

Unmatched Service. Quickest Lead Times. In 1983, Horn Plastics Inc. was started in the garage of founder, Phil Horn to overcome material sticking in elevators throughout the Midwest. Starting out, Phil would load his pickup up with sheets of plastic and hit the road, stopping in every small town along the way until his pickup was empty. In the early years the Horn Plastics Inc.’s trademarked brand, Super-Slide, was a household name in the agriculture industry. As more products were added to the line-up, the aggregate and manufacturing industries became a much larger focus, hoping to help cut down on sticking and help protect the equipment. With a proven concept in hand, Horn Plastics went on the road again in the late 1990s looking for dealers to help get the Super-Slide products in more trucks and trailers across the country. Building up a network of dealers, it was time to expand into the Wisconsin Dells and Boise locations, providing untouched levels of inventory and service across every corner of the United States. In 2019, Tim Horn purchased Horn Plastics Inc. and the Super-Slide brand from his father with the vision of growing the company. With an eye on the future, Horn Plastics Inc looks to add additional locations and grow their dealer network. Promising to continue delivering a strong product and unmatched service.

It’s high grade, durable and dependable with a level of slipperiness that is unmatched. Blue Iron is made from Horn Plastics’ proprietary formula for a superior UHMW. The standard UHMW formula has been improved to enhance the characteristics of UHMW for more demanding applications. It has 2% silicone added and is UV stabilized, setting it apart from its competitors. Compared to UHMW Black liners, Blue Iron has some noticeable differences. First, the black color will absorb more heat from the sun. From that additional heat, there will be more liner expansion and that could cause the liner to bubble. Second, UHMW black liners do not contain silicone. Silicone is a lubricant additive that increases release, amplifies material flow, reduces wear, and decreases frictional heat from sliding materials. Third, Blue Iron UHMW Industrial Hopper Liners are also UV stabilized. UV stabilized additives give additional protection from sunlight which will normally break down a liner over time. UHMW Black – Good material, but if you want quality go with Blue Iron. UHMW Black is an economical UHMW. There are similarities to Blue Iron; however, Blue Iron is a premium product in nearly every aspect. Nevertheless, in less demanding applications with a tight budget, UHMW Black may be a suitable product. Be sure to talk to a Super-Slide representative for advice on the best liner for your application and budget.

Unmatched Service. Quickest Lead Times. In 1983, Horn Plastics Inc. was started in the garage of founder, Phil Horn to overcome material sticking in elevators throughout the Midwest. Starting out, Phil would load his pickup up with sheets of plastic and hit the road, stopping in every small town along the way until his pickup was empty. In the early years the Horn Plastics Inc.’s trademarked brand, Super-Slide, was a household name in the agriculture industry. As more products were added to the line-up, the aggregate and manufacturing industries became a much larger focus, hoping to help cut down on sticking and help protect the equipment. With a proven concept in hand, Horn Plastics went on the road again in the late 1990s looking for dealers to help get the Super-Slide products in more trucks and trailers across the country. Building up a network of dealers, it was time to expand into the Wisconsin Dells and Boise locations, providing untouched levels of inventory and service across every corner of the United States. In 2019, Tim Horn purchased Horn Plastics Inc. and the Super-Slide brand from his father with the vision of growing the company. With an eye on the future, Horn Plastics Inc looks to add additional locations and grow their dealer network. Promising to continue delivering a strong product and unmatched service.
