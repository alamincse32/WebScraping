Safety – Respect – Customer Service – Efficiency Closed captions for this video is available in multiple languages About Us: Our History Where we came from 1983-1993 1983-1993 Remington Seeds was founded by two farmers that saw an opportunity to make a difference in the seed industry. In 1984, Remington Seeds constructed our first high pressure, low temperature drying facility in Remington Indiana. Over the next decade, Remington established itself as a high quality producer of hybrid corn seed. Enduring growing pains and the inclement weather in the 80’s, the culture and philosophy was born. By 1992, Remington constructed a second facility in Sturgis, MI and became a full service option for the seed corn industry, adding conditioning and distribution capabilities. About Us: Our History Growth through hard work 1993-2003 1993-2003 The 2nd decade of Remington Seeds saw expansion west of the Mississippi River and the addition of soybeans and wheat to the list of crops serviced. The acquisition of MD Meyers provided Remington Seeds the ability to service regional demands across the Midwest and spread risk for our customers. About Us: Our History Expanding & Improving 2003-2013 2003-2013 In the 3rd decade, Remington Seeds focused on expanding US operations and improving facilities. Remington strengthened relationships with existing customers and found ways to solve industry issues. A priority was placed on updating technology and processes to put the company in position to adapt to the fast paced, evolving seed business. Remington covered a footprint that went as far south as the Ohio River, North into North Dakota, East to Ohio, and West to central Nebraska. During this time of rapid expansion, Remington Seeds remained dedicated to a customer first philosophy and emphasized the need to keep processes simple. About Us: Our History Growing around the world 2013-Present 2013-Present By 2015, Remington Seeds had upwards of 40 locations across the Midwest. We saw the opportunity to better service customers by expanding into sunflowers and sorghum, adding facilities in California and Texas. Remington also saw the opportunity to provide the same services to customers abroad in Europe and Mexico. In 2018, Remington Seeds partnered with Satus Ager, a seed production company based in Argentina, to expand opportunities for customers in South America. Even as we continue to expand internationally, the vision for Remington Seeds remains the same as it was in 1984. Find ways to add value to the seed industry and make customers happy.

We know that in order to retain the highest caliber talent, they must be treated right. The company was founded on treating employees like family and that continues to be an important part of our culture. We provide a safe, respectful, and fun place to work.

Efficiency The tool that we use to provide outstanding experiences to our customers and employees. As a company, we strive to become as efficient as possible. Careers: Position Roles A melting pot of individuals with the same goal in mind. Remington Seeds employs a large cross section of individuals. We have many jobs that are seasonal in nature and some that require specific skills. Everyone in our organization has the same goal, produce high quality seed and make our customers happy. Full Time – Hourly Employees Our full time employees are the backbone of Remington Seeds. These individuals often wear multiple “hats” throughout the year as our seasons change. A full time employee must be able to perform multiple tasks and embody our culture. Full time staff receive multiple benefits along with participation in our profit sharing bonus program. Seasonal/Part Time Employees For a variety of jobs, Remington Seeds hires Seasonal and Part Time employees. Harvest requires an influx of labor for a short period. These positions are a great way to get familiar with Remington Seeds and learn about our business and culture. Many employees hired in these positions find themselves offered permanent roles within the company. Location Management A small group of managers guides each Remington Seeds location. Managers typically focus on one aspect of location business, field or plant operations, with one Location Manager guiding those divisions along the way. Management is expected to get their hands dirty when necessary and ensure that the business principles and core values are being practiced. Regional and Crop Leadership Each crop has a small team of managers that direct the locations from a central system. Remington Seeds has a hierarchy but without corporate bureaucracy. Regional and Crop Management drive our company in directions that ensure we are successful year to year. Administrative Staff Remington’s corporate office handles human resources, financial services and data systems. These administrators offer the necessary support to our employees at the location level that helps Remington Seeds succeed. They understand, although they don’t directly work with products, that the end goal is to provide high quality seed to our customers. Careers: Management Trainee Gain experience to enrich your career path. Remington Seeds realizes the need to give young and talented individuals opportunities to learn and grow. Our Management Trainee program gives a platform for that opportunity and, if successful, produces an effective and successful manager for a number of our facilities. A management trainee spends 1-2 years at one location, learning management style, processes, and Remington’s culture and then is transferred to another Remington Seeds facility in a different crop to learn the nuances of that facility. In the end, we hope an individual has a well-rounded and broad education of the seed industry and our philosophy. If successful, that individual is ready to become part of location management where Remington Seeds sees the best outcome.

Remington Seeds is one of the largest third party seed producers in the world.

Remington’s culture of customer service and quality is imbedded in our employees who accept the challenge of providing the highest quality seed for our customer.

Beginning in 2021 Guillaume and Natalia will serve as the CEO and President of Remington Seeds. Their combined experience in global seed production is unrivaled within the industry. Safety – Respect – Customer Service – Efficiency Closed captions for this video is available in multiple languages About Us: Our History Where we came from 1983-1993 1983-1993 Remington Seeds was founded by two farmers that saw an opportunity to make a difference in the seed industry. In 1984, Remington Seeds constructed our first high pressure, low temperature drying facility in Remington Indiana. Over the next decade, Remington established itself as a high quality producer of hybrid corn seed. Enduring growing pains and the inclement weather in the 80’s, the culture and philosophy was born. By 1992, Remington constructed a second facility in Sturgis, MI and became a full service option for the seed corn industry, adding conditioning and distribution capabilities. About Us: Our History Growth through hard work 1993-2003 1993-2003 The 2nd decade of Remington Seeds saw expansion west of the Mississippi River and the addition of soybeans and wheat to the list of crops serviced. The acquisition of MD Meyers provided Remington Seeds the ability to service regional demands across the Midwest and spread risk for our customers. About Us: Our History Expanding & Improving 2003-2013 2003-2013 In the 3rd decade, Remington Seeds focused on expanding US operations and improving facilities. Remington strengthened relationships with existing customers and found ways to solve industry issues. A priority was placed on updating technology and processes to put the company in position to adapt to the fast paced, evolving seed business. Remington covered a footprint that went as far south as the Ohio River, North into North Dakota, East to Ohio, and West to central Nebraska. During this time of rapid expansion, Remington Seeds remained dedicated to a customer first philosophy and emphasized the need to keep processes simple. About Us: Our History Growing around the world 2013-Present 2013-Present By 2015, Remington Seeds had upwards of 40 locations across the Midwest. We saw the opportunity to better service customers by expanding into sunflowers and sorghum, adding facilities in California and Texas. Remington also saw the opportunity to provide the same services to customers abroad in Europe and Mexico. In 2018, Remington Seeds partnered with Satus Ager, a seed production company based in Argentina, to expand opportunities for customers in South America. Even as we continue to expand internationally, the vision for Remington Seeds remains the same as it was in 1984. Find ways to add value to the seed industry and make customers happy.

Careers: Position Roles A melting pot of individuals with the same goal in mind. Remington Seeds employs a large cross section of individuals. We have many jobs that are seasonal in nature and some that require specific skills. Everyone in our organization has the same goal, produce high quality seed and make our customers happy. Full Time – Hourly Employees Our full time employees are the backbone of Remington Seeds. These individuals often wear multiple “hats” throughout the year as our seasons change. A full time employee must be able to perform multiple tasks and embody our culture. Full time staff receive multiple benefits along with participation in our profit sharing bonus program. Seasonal/Part Time Employees For a variety of jobs, Remington Seeds hires Seasonal and Part Time employees. Harvest requires an influx of labor for a short period. These positions are a great way to get familiar with Remington Seeds and learn about our business and culture. Many employees hired in these positions find themselves offered permanent roles within the company. Location Management A small group of managers guides each Remington Seeds location. Managers typically focus on one aspect of location business, field or plant operations, with one Location Manager guiding those divisions along the way. Management is expected to get their hands dirty when necessary and ensure that the business principles and core values are being practiced.

Careers: Management Trainee Gain experience to enrich your career path. Remington Seeds realizes the need to give young and talented individuals opportunities to learn and grow. Our Management Trainee program gives a platform for that opportunity and, if successful, produces an effective and successful manager for a number of our facilities. A management trainee spends 1-2 years at one location, learning management style, processes, and Remington’s culture and then is transferred to another Remington Seeds facility in a different crop to learn the nuances of that facility. In the end, we hope an individual has a well-rounded and broad education of the seed industry and our philosophy. If successful, that individual is ready to become part of location management where Remington Seeds sees the best outcome.
