They are a solid company that delivers on their promises with outstanding organization and execution.” Jon Wolff Engelsma “I appreciate the professionalism, engagement, and involvement of the Taracon Precast team, especially Lloyd. They produce a high quality product and are very efficient in meeting the timeline and goals of each project.

Even after years in the construction industry, it was fun to watch how quickly and efficiently the concrete panels went up on the parking garage.” Bernie Dardis Mayor of West Fargo “I would recommend anyone in the construction business to consider the benefits Taracon Precast provides as a one-stop precast supplier.

This results in exposure of the aggregate with a smooth polished finish similar to polished granite. Acid Etched This process uses acid with high pressure water to etch the surface of the concrete. This usually darkens the finish and leaves a sparkle or “sugar-cube” effect. Abrasive Blasted (e.g. sand-blasted) This process uses a blasting material (commonly sand) to abrade away the surface, exposing the sand and stone. This typically frosts and lightens the surface. Thin Bricks Thin brick wall panels create the look of a traditional brick structure but with the cost and time saving benefits of precast. We use natural clay brick products cast into the precast wall panel to achieve this finish. Exposed Aggregate This process uses a chemical surface retarder which is applied onto the forms prior to casting. The chemical retards the set of the cement so that it may be removed (usually by water blasting) the next day. This results in exposure of the aggregate while preserving its natural beauty and texture. Custom/Form Liners Since precast concrete is cast into forms, a variety of shapes and details can be accomplished in precast concrete. Formliners can also be used, especially when repetitive patterns or unique textures are needed. As-Cast (i.e. form finish) This requires no additional finishing. The surface is left as is, as it comes out of the form. Hammer Brushed Uses brushes up to 1000 Grit. This results in a textured finish that has a smooth brushed/polished finish. Lightly Brushed Brick Use a series of brushes to add a textured finish to the precast. Taracon Precast Project Gallery PCI Color and Texture Guide Ready to discuss your next construction project?

Guided by your design specifications and preferred finishes, our experts create a precast form as the foundation in bringing your project vision to life.We work with precision to create forms that meet designer specifications for shape, size, and durability, as well as highlight the intricate details you desire. Our precast architectural concrete can be customized by color, aggregate, sand type, and texture. Additional elements can be integrated directly into each cast such as patterns, reveals, brick veneers, form liner, and polished or brushed finishes, allowing for unique and visually appealing features in the surface of the panel. No two construction jobs are alike, and we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each project. Our precast concrete design finishes include:Polished BrushedExposed AggregatesForm LinerSand-BlastedAcid EtchedThin In-Lay BrickBroom At Taracon Precast, we manufacture versatile precast concrete wall panels, ideal for complex building designs and structures. Based on the project’s specifications, our panels can be designed to have a high loading capacity, or to function exclusively as an architectural feature that offers no structural support. Our world class products minimize the need for excessive steel and masonry construction, and offer a substantial level of ease and simplicity when building envelopes for commercial, industrial, residential, and other structures.The benefits of utilizing structural precast concrete include faster construction times, general cost savings, design flexibility, lower long-term maintenance costs, controlled sound transmission, and sustainability.Taracon Precast offers three types of structural precast concrete wall panels:Solid wall panels: Manufactured with a solid concrete design without an insulated component. Sandwich wall panels: Composed of two concrete wythes, separated by a layer of insulation and connected by wythe connectors.Composite wall panels: The two concrete wythes work together to resist applied loads. These panels are typically thinner and lighter weight. Hollowcore SlabsWe know that durable flooring is critical in creating a successful building structure. Our prestressed hollowcore slabs are designed as structural flooring components but can also be used as roof deck components in buildings that have multiple levels.Taracon Precast’s hollowcore slabs unique design features hollowed out voids that run along the length of each panel. These tubular voids dramatically reduce the overall weight of each panel, without sacrificing its structural strength. The result is an easy-to-handle building component, spanning large areas and eliminating the need for any additional steel or masonry work.The hollow cores offer a variety of benefits for the construction process, including easy access for trade workers, the ability to act as service ducts, and accommodation for wiring and the installation of other components. If the interior of each tubular void is coated with insulating material, the slabs can also function as ventilation ducts. “¼” std rake finishWeepholes on all hollow-coreForm fill optionsFire rating of 2 hoursPrecast Hollowcore Slab SpecificationsOur prestressed hollowcore slabs, also called hollow core planks, concrete planks, or voided slabs, are available in a variety of lengths and thicknesses, from six to 16 inches and width of 47.75 inches.The voids in each slab usually have a diameter that is equal to approximately 2/3 to 3/4 of the slab section. The thickness of each plank is dependent on the ultimate length requirement, allowing an increase in thickness of the plank correlating with an increase in length.Hollowcore slabs vary by depth, length, and loading performance, and can be manufactured to suit the specifications of each construction project. Benefits of Hollowcore SlabsOur precast hollowcore slabs are significantly lighter when compared to solid precast concrete floor slabs and are easier to lift and handle during the construction process. In addition to being manufactured with high-strength concrete mixtures, our precast slabs are reinforced with steel strands that run through the length of each slab. The materials and design process used to create Taracon Precast’s hollowcore precast concrete slabs and floor panels make them naturally highly resistant to fire and sound transfer.The smart design of our precast hollowcore slabs reduces material costs, offers faster construction time, and lower overall maintenance costs. Buildings that are constructed with our precast concrete products have superior thermal efficiency which leads to long-term savings in energy costs.

Double tees are a design marvel, combining the strength and durability inherent in both steel and concrete. Fused together in a unique “double tee” configuration, this product has superior load bearing capacities when compared to hollow core slabs of equal length. Double tees feature a horizontal section (flange) and two stemmed vertical sections (webs) with the ability to support a high volume of weight, while also spanning significant distances. Double tees can be designed with openings in between the stems, offering additional features such as mechanical ducts, windows, and skylights integrated into the structure. There are many structural applications in which Taracon Precast’s precast double tees are superior components to utilize:BridgesPool FacilitiesIndustrial BuildingsWater & Sewage Treatment PlantsRoofingGymnasiumWarehouse FacilitiesParking StructuresCommercial BuildingsFood Processing FacilitiesPodiumStandard Width and Spans: Double tees are usually manufactured in a range of standard widths and spans.8' wide, up to a 120' span10' wide, up to a 90' span12' wide, up to a 70' spanBenefits of Double TeesWe specialize in producing superior double tee precast concrete products. Using Taracon Precast double tees as a part of your unique construction project offers a wide array of cost-saving benefits, including fast construction times, design flexibility, potentially lower insurance costs, decreased maintenance, and exceptional durability.Our quality-controlled production process results in high density and strength while offering exceptional impact and corrosion resistance, along with enhanced safety and security features. Prestressing our double tee components delivers a product that reduces the possibility of cracking, while increasing the load capacity of the finished structure. Double tee precast concrete has a high fire resistance rating and can withstand two to four hours of continual fire damage without losing its integrity.After production, double tees are transported to the worksite for immediate erection, keeping construction time on schedule, while reducing related costs and shortening the project time to completion. In many scenarios, utilizing precast double tee concrete has made it possible to reduce overall construction times by up to 80 percent. Columns and BeamsTaracon Precast’s precast concrete beams and columns provide the perfect foundation for mounting precast architectural and structural panels, as well as hollowcore slabs and double tees. Once erected, the beam and column components offer a seamless and streamlined appearance to the entire structure of the building.All of our precast concrete beams and columns offer time and cost-saving benefits to professionals in the construction industry.
