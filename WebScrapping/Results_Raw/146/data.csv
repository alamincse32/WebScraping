Home Cutting Forming Welding Machining Painting Quality About Careers Contact ©2023 Weisgram Metal Fab, Inc. • 701.492.3433 • Contact • Careers Equal Opportunity Employer CuttingTube Laser CuttingPlate Laser CuttingMechanical Sawing We put 2,000,000 pounds of steel 30 feet in the air to save space on our floor. What does that say about the lengths we’ll go to be more efficient? Our laser automation—one of the only systems of its kind in the country—allows us to double our capacity while reducing the number of times we touch the steel. Nitrogen cutting—well, it simply offers the cleanest cut you’re ever going to see in steel up to ¼”. Now that might sound like a fabrication, but we’d love the chance to prove it to you. If you’re surprised to hear we have tube laser cutting capabilities (because many shops don’t), wait until you see what they can do. Three, six-axis machines offer any cut and every angle in a single program cycle: Part Size Max Weight: 2,425 lbs.

7,"About | Weisgram Metal Fab, Inc. Home Cutting Forming Welding Machining Painting Quality About Careers Contact ©2023 Weisgram Metal Fab, Inc. • 701.492.3433 • Contact • Careers Equal Opportunity Employer About It might be easier to run a company when you don’t concern yourself so much with quality and customer loyalty. But that’s not how we’re built. Joel Weisgram started this company as a two-person shop, taking in small welding jobs and putting out a product other companies couldn’t touch. He believed wholeheartedly in doing what he said he was going to do, and he expected the same from his employees. That’s probably why there are more than 200 people working for the family today. Joel is still active in the business with his sons, Ryan and Chad, and Weisgram is now one of the largest family-owned companies in the region. We’ve invested millions in technology and equipment. But our purpose is still the same: to do what we say, no matter what you ask. That’s the kind of people we are, and we’re fairly certain that’s the kind of people you like doing business with."
