Buyer acknowledges that these Terms to NPP, along with any attachments, price lists, schedules, quotation, acknowledgments, or invoice from NPP relevant to the sale of the Goods (collectively, “Attachment”), and all documents incorporated by specific reference into these Terms or any Attachment, constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the Agreement governing all sales of Goods by NPP to Buyer (“Agreement”), regardless of whether or not Buyer or NPP expressly make reference to these Terms in any documentation related to any such sale. Buyer’s acceptance of the Goods will manifest Buyer’s assent to these Terms without variance or addition. NPP hereby objects to and rejects any terms in Buyer’s purchase order or other Buyer documents that are different than or in addition to these Terms, and such terms shall not constitute any part of the Agreement between Buyer and NPP. Any Attachment is incorporated herein by reference. NPP reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse orders. 1. PricesAll NPP prices are based on written, authorized NPP quotes while they remain in effect for the duration set forth in the quote. Fixed price quotes are void and invalid after the quote expiration date and the price of Goods are then subject to change without notice and the prices invoiced will be those in effect at the time of shipment. 2. Order AcceptanceNo order placed with NPP shall be considered accepted until acknowledged in writing by NPP. NPP reserves the right to accept or reject any order. The Terms and Conditions stated herein constitute the entire terms and conditions of sale between the parties. A price quote by NPP does not constitute the acceptance of an order. 3. CancellationIn the event of Buyer cancellation of standard orders prior to shipment, orders shall be subject to liquidated damages for the cost of labor, storage, and overhead, in the amount of ten percent (10%) of sales price. Nonstandard orders, custom-produced Goods, special orders, Vinyltech Corporation Goods for resale, and purple pipe orders that are cancelled by Buyer shall be subject to liquidated damages for the cost of labor, materials, storage, packaging, overhead and profit, in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of sales price. 4. Shipment and Delivery and FreightNPP will use reasonable efforts to meet the requested shipment schedule, but not guarantee a delivery time, and assumes no liability for additional costs or damages resulting from late deliveries. Unless otherwise stated, all shipments are F.O.B Shipping Point with transportation prepaid by NPP and allowed to jobsite or Buyer’s stocking location, whichever applies, provided jobsite is legally and physically accessible to interstate freight carriers operating under I.C.C. and state D.O.T. by regulations. Additional freight charges shall be paid Buyer for less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments, Stop-over/Drop shipments, delays caused by Buyer or Buyer’s customer and demurrage. 5. Examination and Receipt of GoodsAll claims for damage in transit or shortage or shipping errors shall be noted on Bill of Lading, which shall be signed by Buyer or Buyer’s customer/agent, and the carrier (truck driver). Buyer or Buyer’s customer/agent shall be responsible for making a careful and complete examination of the Goods at time of delivery and unloading to assure that the shipment is accurate according to the Bill of Lading and quantities ordered and that the Goods are received in good condition with no damage. NPP will not accept or honor claims for shipping damage or quantity shortages or shipping errors that are not properly documented on the Bill of Lading as described in this Section 5. 6.

Terms of PaymentUnless otherwise specified by NPP, terms are net thirty (30) days from the date of NPP’s invoice in U.S. currency. NPP has the right, among other remedies, either to terminate the Agreement and/or purchase order with Buyer or to suspend further performance under this Agreement, any other agreements and/or purchase orders with Buyer in the event NPP fails to receive any payment when due, which other agreements and/or purchase orders Buyer and NPP hereby amend accordingly to incorporate these Terms, or if NPP otherwise deems itself insecure. Buyer shall be liable for all expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs, relating to the collection of past due amounts. In the event Buyer fails to make any payment to NPP when due, Buyer’s entire account(s) with NPP shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand by NPP. If any payment owed to NPP is not paid when due, it shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by NPP, which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law, from the date on which it is due until it is paid. Should Buyer’s financial responsibility become unsatisfactory to NPP, cash payments or security satisfactory to NPP may be required by NPP for future deliveries and for Goods delivered up to that point. If such cash payment or security is not provided, in addition to NPP’s other rights and remedies, NPP may discontinue deliveries. Buyer hereby grants NPP a purchase money security interest in all Goods sold to Buyer by NPP, which security interest shall continue until such Goods are fully paid for in cash, and Buyer (a) upon NPP’s demand, will execute and deliver to NPP such instruments as NPP requests to protect and perfect such security interest, and (b) authorizes NPP to execute and file such instruments as are necessary or useful to protect and perfect such interest. No Goods furnished by NPP to Buyer shall become a fixture as a result of such Goods being attached to realty. 8. Limited WarrantyNPP warrants to the Buyer that the Goods are free from defects in materials and workmanship and that the Goods are manufactured in accordance with industry standard material specifications. It is the Buyer’s or Buyer’s customer’s responsibility to carefully inspect and/or test the product to insure that it performs satisfactorily for its intended use. Every claim under this warranty shall be deemed waived unless made in writing and received by NPP within thirty (30) days of the date the defect was discovered and one (1) year of the date of the shipment of the Goods. NPP makes no other representation or warranty of any kind, except for our standard warranty, express or implied, in fact or in law, including without limitation, the warranty of merchantability or the warranty of fitness for the above.

In no event shall NPP be liable for any alleged negligence, breach of warranty, strict liability, incidental or consequential damages, or any other theory, other than the liability set forth above. This warranty is void if the Goods are damaged by the carrier or Buyer, or Buyer’s customer. This warranty is void if the spigot end of NPP’s pipe is over-inserted past the stop mark. 9. Limitation of LiabilityNPP shall not be liable for damages caused by delay in performance, or non-performance, regardless of the form of the claim or cause of action (whether based in contract, infringement, negligence, strict liability, other tort or otherwise), and in no event shall NPP’s liability to Buyer and/or its buyers exceed the price paid by Buyer for the specific Goods provided by NPP giving rise to the claim or cause of action, and Buyer shall indemnify NPP for any damages in excess thereof. In no event shall NPP’s liability to Buyer and/or its customers extend to include direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, all of which are waived by Buyer and as to which Buyer shall indemnify NPP. The term “consequential damages” as used in these Terms shall include, but not be limited to, fines, penalties, loss of anticipated profits, business interruption, loss of use of revenue, cost of capital, loss or damage to property or equipment, loss of reputation, or illness. Further, Buyer shall indemnify and hold NPP harmless from any liability to Buyer, Buyer’s employees, workers, contractors or any other persons arising out of Buyer’s or any other persons’ use of Goods.

Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless NPP and its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates and agents against any loss, damage, claim , suit, liability, judgment or expense (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees) arising out of or in connection with any injury to, damage to, death to or loss of any persons or property, or violation of any applicable laws or regulations resulting from or in connection with the sale, transportation, installation, use or repair of Goods by Buyer. This Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 10. TaxesAny current or future tax or any charge of any nature imposed by any governmental or taxing authority that is or becomes payable by reason of the production, transportation, sale, storage, processing, use, consumption or delivery of Goods sold to Buyer, other than taxes based on NPP’s net income or profit, will be for Buyer’s account and will either be added to the price of Goods and paid for by Buyer or billed to Buyer separately and paid for by Buyer, as NPP may elect in its sole discretion. 11. AssignmentBuyer shall not assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of NPP, and any such assignment, without such consent, shall be void. 12. Force MajeureNPP shall not be liable for damage resulting from delay in performance or for non-performance, directly or indirectly caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, including, but not limited to acts of God, fires, acts of the Devil, explosions, floods, war, acts of or authorized by any government commission, agency or jurisdiction, accident, labor or storage trouble, or inability to obtain material, equipment or transportation. Quantities so affected may be eliminated from the Agreement without liability, but the Agreement shall remain otherwise unaffected. NPP shall have no obligation to purchase supplies of the Goods specified herein to enable it to perform this Agreement. 13. Governing LawThese Terms shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of North Dakota, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Buyer and NPP agree that the proper venue for all actions arising in connection with these Terms shall be deemed exclusively proper only in state or federal courts in Cass County, North Dakota and the parties agree to submit to such jurisdiction or at NPP’s sole election, to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures, with such arbitration to take place in Cass County, North Dakota. 14. MiscellaneousAll rights and remedies of NPP in these Terms are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that NPP may have at law or in equity. These Terms supersede all other communications, negotiations and prior oral or written statements regarding the subject matter of these Terms. 1302 39th Street NW Fargo, ND 58102-2808 (701) 282-7655 Terms & Conditions Warranty Buy America Build America © 2023 Northern Pipe Products. | Created by Off The Wall Advertising | Privacy Policy Close Menu Products C900 Gasketed Sewer Pipe IPS Pressure Pipe Well Casing Drain Waste Vent Bell End Sewer Pipe Install About Employment Contact About Us Employment"

This locked-in-place design prevents fishmouthing or accidental dislocation of the sealing gasket when pipe spigots are inserted in the bell joint. Do not attempt to remove the gasket from the gasket groove. The pipe-coupling gasket should be carefully inspected and cleaned to insure that no dirt or foreign matter is between the gasket and the pipe. After the pipe is placed in the trench the coupling should again be inspected to confirm that no dirt is in the gasket groove area. Pipe lubricant should be placed on the gasket face and on the spigot end of the pipe to the insertion line. Make certain the pipe end is supported off the ground so the lubricant does not pick up dirt. The pipe then should be inserted into the bell, aligned, and carefully pushed past the gasket. The spigot insertion mark is a “reference mark” to indicate the proper depth of insertion. In a properly assembled pipe-to-pipe joint, the insertion mark is flush with the lip of the adjoining bell. Care must be taken to insure that the spigot is not over-inserted. Use extreme care when assembling gasketed pipe with bar and block method or a machine such as a backhoe to prevent joint misalignment or over-insertion. Do not swing or stab the joint together. If the pipe does not go into the bell to the insertion mark, this may be an indication of a pushed gasket. A feeler gauge can be used to determine the position of the gasket in the coupling. If pipe assembly is at the trench side and then lowered, the same procedure is followed. As the pipe is lowered into the trench, holding pressure should be exerted on the end of the pipe, thus preventing movement in the bell after insertion. The pipe should be inspected to insure no lessening of insertion depth has occurred. Usually pipe larger than 8″ diameter is assembled in the trench. Field cutting the pipe may be necessary. Square cuts are essential. Northern Pipe Products Inc. recommends the use of a wheel type cutter and a mechanical beveler to complete the cutting procedure. After the cut is made, the pipe should be beveled smoothly to the original degree of the factory bevel. Fittings are usually gasketed slip joint fittings manufactured from PVC. Care must be taken to avoid rolling or cutting the fitting gasket. The same lubrication procedure used on the pipe is recommended for placement of the fitting. ASSEMBLY OF SOLVENT WELDED PIPE Solvent welding or cementing pipe joints may be selected as an alternate method of installation. Although the pipe is of the same material as that with a gasket joint, the method of connecting the pipe is quite different. Clean and dry the spigot and bell socket of all dirt, moisture, and grease. Using a clean brush or applicator, coat the inside of the socket with cleaner solvent. Avoid puddles or amounts of standing solvent in the coupling. Apply a coat of cleaner solvent to the spigot end of the pipe. Apply the filler solvent cement to the spigot end of the pipe ONLY. Rebrush the bell socket quickly with cleaner solvent. Push the spigot into the socket, turn 1/8 to 1/4 turn pushing the pipe completely into the bell socket making sure the spigot bottoms out at the full socket depth. Hold firmly until the joint is set up (usually a matter of seconds). As the pipe is joined, a bead of solvent should appear at the outside edge of the socket. Wipe off the excess solvent with a clean rag or paper towel. Final setup and curing time varies depending on pipe size, temperature, and humidity. Longer setup time is necessary in colder weather. More care is needed to be sure the welding solvent has cut into the pipe. Allow at least 24 hours before testing the joint. More workers may be needed to handle larger diameter solvent welding. In sizes above 6″ diameter, three workers are typically used, two to make the solvent joint and one to insert and turn the pipe. CUTTING & BEVELING PVC PIPE Installation Sheet CUTTING PVC PIPE A square cut is essential when making a field cut of PVC pipe. PVC pipe can be easily cut with a fine tooth hacksaw or a handsaw. Power type saws with steel blades or abrasive discs can also be used. It is recommended that the pipe be marked around its entire circumference prior to cutting to assure a square cut. BEVELING PVC PIPE After a pipe is field cut, assure that the pipe is beveled. Use a factory finished beveled end as a guide to determine the angle and the length of the taper. The end may be beveled using a plastic pipe beveling tool, a course file or rasp, or the abrasive disc power tool that was used to cut the pipe. PVC PIPE EMBEDMENT Installation Sheet PVC PIPE EMBEDMENT Proper compacting of the bedding material in the haunching area is the most important criteria to limit the deflection of a flexible PVC pipe. Embedment material should be placed and consolidated under the pipe haunch area and through the initial backfill area to provide adequate side support to the pipe while avoiding both vertical and lateral displacement of the pipe from proper alignment. Initial backfill is that portion of the pipe embedment beginning at the springline of the pipe and extending over the top of the pipe. This area should also be properly compacted to aid in limiting pipe deflection. Embedment materials suitable for proper compaction shall be used in the entire embedment zone. PVC PIPE DEFLECTION Installation Sheet In large water projects such as rural water and irrigation systems, both gasketed pipe joints and solvent cemented joints are quite common. Use of a plow, trencher, or backhoe may be used in pipe placement. Some pipe may be placed through a plow chute or from the top of the ground behind the trencher or backhoe. In all cases, care must be taken not to exceed the recommended curvature limits for the pipe or serious pipe stress and breakage could occur. The response of PVC pipe to longitudinal bending is considered a significant advantage of PVC pipe in buried applications. PVC pipe may be deliberately curved during the installation operation to make a change in alignment and grade, or to make a change in direction. The shortest longitudinal bending radius allowed for PVC pipe is equal to 300 times the pipe’s outside diameter. Most sewer projects do not allow for bends and curves but rather a straight line and grade from manhole to manhole. As with pressure pipe, Northern Pipe Products Inc. PVC sewer pipe may also be curved to allow for bending in the trenching operation to make a change in alignment and grade, or to make a gradual change in direction. The next charts define the minimum radius of curvature and the maximum recommended offset per length of pipe. PRESSURE PIPE BENDING ALLOWANCE Pipe Diameter (in.) Pipe Length (ft.)

There are several practices common to all backfilling. PVC pipe must be installed with proper bedding to provide support under the pipe. Initial backfilling should be completed as soon as possible after the pipe is laid because this will protect the pipe from shifting due to cave-ins. Material immediately surrounding the pipe should not exceed 3/4″ size. All voids under and around the sides of the pipe should be hand filled and compacted. If joints are to be left open for inspection during testing, the center section of the pipe must be covered and compacted to eliminate movement of the pipe when pressurized. If backfill material is put over the pipe in lifts and mechanically compacted, extreme care must be used not to fracture the pipe. Never use a hydrohammer compactor directly over the pipe until at least 30″ of backfill material has been placed. All backfill material should be void of rock, frozen chunks and debris. FILLING THE LINE The pipe line should be filled as slowly as possible (not more than 1 ft/sec) to avoid any unnecessary surges. Venting air from the line during filling is of major importance. The line can be filled from any available water source. The water can be introduced from lines already in service through valved connections. Northern Pipe Products Inc. recommends filling the new pipeline from the lowest point in the line. Where a portion of pipe is to be tested but has not yet been tied to the final source, another source of water must be found. To avoid water hammer during the filling process, always fill the line slowly. Avoid high water velocities because the resulting water hammer could cause pipe failure. Air needs to be vented out of the filled line at all high spots while filling and before making pressure and leakage tests. Automatic air release valves are recommended. TESTING Installation Sheet TESTING PVC PRESSURE PIPE The testing procedures and requirements are usually stated in the project specifications. The following are Northern Pipe Products Inc. recommendations for testing PVC pressure pipe: The testing connection location should be at the lowest point of the line to be tested. Be sure all blocking is in place (if concrete is used it must be cured to the necessary strength to withstand the pressure). Pipe must be back-filled properly before testing. The ends must be capped and blocked. Absolutely do not use air pressure for testing. Only hydrostatic testing is recommended. Flush lines thoroughly to remove as much existing air as possible. If air pockets remain, it will be very difficult to complete testing. Pipe should not be tested beyond 100% of the pressure rating of the pipe. The leakage allowance can be calculated from the chart on the next page. If the quantity of pipe to be tested is large, the test should be done in sections. If the pipe is to be tested before it is tied to a final water source, an alternate water source may be needed. The quantity of water to fill the line can be determined from the chart on the next page.

Each Engineer will specify the type of tests required. The test could vary from a ball and cleaning test, a visual test, a leakage test, a low-pressure air test, infiltration or exfiltration test, or a pipe deflection test. Each test has its own specific methods. Testing is generally done between two consecutive manholes. When testing, it is very important to make sure that the lines are clean. The ball test will usually accomplish this by flushing an appropriate size cleaning ball through the line. Simple visual lamping with mirrors and lights can be used for visual tests, or a closed circuit television can also be used. Leakage tests, whether for air or water leakage, may be taken. It is extremely important that all branch connections be capped and secured before this type of test is attempted. Air testing sewer line can be done with very low pressure. At no time should the air pressure exceed 9 PSI. When using infiltration and exfiltration testing, generally applied requirements show that leakage should not exceed fifty gallons per inch of external pipe diameter per mile of pipe per day. Other requirements regarding level of water must be met to accomplish this kind of testing. In deflection testing, the maximum allowable pipe deflection (which is reducing the vertical inside diameter) is 7.5%. Proper placement and compaction of the backfill material in the embedment zone of the pipe in the installation process is the key to maintaining minimum deflection. Deflection tests are taken with a proper size mandrel or sewer ball that is put through the pipe on a go or no-go basis. Again it must be emphasized that to ensure accurate testing, the lines must be thoroughly cleaned previous to testing. Other specific testing details may be found in the ASTM D2321 Specification on the Standard Recommended Practice for Underground Installations of PVC Sewer Pipe, or in the PVC pipe installation chapter of the Handbook of PVC Pipe Design and Construction Manual published by the Uni-Bell Plastic Pipe Association. SERVICE LINES ON PVC SEWER PIPE Service lines running from the main sewer line to the unit being serviced are installed in the same manner as the main line using proper installation procedures. If main line full wyes have been installed, put the correct bend into the outlet of the wye and lay the service line to the unit, making the connection at that point. It is extremely important when making the connection to the main that proper bedding and compaction is done at the point of connection to prevent any movement, collapse, or deflection. If the full wye has not been installed in the line, a saddle type wye must be installed on the pipe to gain entry for the service line. Care must be exercised when preparing the main line for this saddle. The saddle wye has a unique centering ring feature. A template is provided which is placed on the main line and a hole cut to the exact size. When the hole is completed, use care to clean, making sure that no rough edges remain. Stainless steel galvanized straps should be used to secure the wye in position after the solvent has been applied to the saddle and the pipe.The fitting or bend needed to make the correct position of the service line can then be placed and the service line laid to the unit. The same method of carefully trenching, placing, and backfilling done on the main lines should be in practice on the service lines. TRENCHING Installation Sheet Care must be taken not to drag PVC pipe on the ground and cause wear on the pipe or to the spigot. Any excessively rough handling of the pipe can lead to leaks and breaks when the system is activated and pressurized. TRENCHING AND EXCAVATING Refer to OSHA standards regarding current safety regulations pertaining to excavation. The trench shall be sloped, supported, or drained when necessary so that the workers can work safely. The trench depth should be at least 6″ below the deepest frost penetration. TRENCH WIDTH The trench width at the ground surface may vary with and depend upon the depth and the type of soils. The minimum clear width of the trench measured at the springline of the pipe should be at least one foot greater than the outside diameter of the pipe to enable backfill material to be installed in the haunching area. If this trench width is exceeded, pipe zone haunching should be compacted to a point of at least 3 pipe diameters from the pipe on both sides of the pipe or to the trench walls, whichever is less. PREPARATION OF TRENCH BOTTOM Regardless of the type of excavating equipment used, the trench bottom should be smooth and free from rocks, dirt clods, and frozen material. If the trench bottom is hard, a 4″ layer of soft granular material should be spread evenly along the bottom of the trench. 1302 39th Street NW Fargo, ND 58102-2808 (701) 282-7655 Terms & Conditions Warranty Buy America Build America © 2023 Northern Pipe Products. | Created by Off The Wall Advertising | Privacy Policy Close Menu Products C900 Gasketed Sewer Pipe IPS Pressure Pipe Well Casing Drain Waste Vent Bell End Sewer Pipe Install About Employment Contact About Us Employment"
