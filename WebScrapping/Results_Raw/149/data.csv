Job safety, complexity, scheduling, craft integration and budget management are all considerations during the placement of industrial equipment. Since it’s inception, Wrigley Mechanical has prided itself in creative problem solving; this is certainly the case when large pieces of equipment need to be placed. Jacking, moving, cribbing, rolling, hoisting, and final alignment are all tasks under Wrigley Mechanical’s umbrella of core services. No matter what we are moving, our number one priority is the safety of project personnel and owners’ equipment. You can feel confident that your job will be done right. Process Piping Wrigley Mechanical is fully licensed by the governing boards that oversee the demands of mechanical installations. Supervisors are licensed as plumbers and steamfitters, and all crewmembers are licensed members of their trades, usually as journeyman and apprentices. Welders are certified for power piping, ASME work or specific job related piping applications (i.e.: 304SS, 316SS, 310SS, PVC, HDPE, Carbon, Corten, and High Chrome). Wrigley Mechanical crew-members don’t hesitate on the job when their work is critical. In below-zero weather or extreme heat, Wrigley’s dedicated crew is prepared and able to deal with the conditions. Boiler Equipment & Construction Boiler technology has progressed a great deal in recent years, keeping pace with advanced computerization and increasingly strict environmental regulations. From packaged boilers to field erected boiler systems designed on the job site to fit limited spaces, we have a history of reliability and experience. Wrigley Mechanical can install or repair boilers of all types, fired by any kind of fuel. The company prides itself on creative solutions to the difficult questions that seem to always appear during a boiler installation. Under all conditions and tight deadlines, during shutdown periods and outages, reliable Wrigley field supervisors and crew-members continue to reinforce a reputation for excellence throughout the boiler industry. Oil & Gas From our fabrication services to field construction, the oil and gas industry is a constantly growing part of our business. Wrigley Mechanical has been involved in a wide variety of oil and gas projects throughout the upper Midwest, including waste heat recovery, power generation, pipeline station fabrication, repairs on piping systems, separators, and compressor station jet change outs. Working with the owners our mechanics supply what is necessary through startup. Being an ASME certified company, we have an in-house Quality Control Manager who oversees all code welding. In addition we comply with the necessary API codes and have performed chart recorded hydro tests in excess of 3,200 PSIG. Working in the oil and gas industry we are accustomed to NDE (X-ray, mag particle, and UT) along with performing hydro tests on various fabrications and installations. Welding Today’s mechanical construction requires a wide variety of welding capabilities. Wrigley Mechanical is capable of welding carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, high chrome, inconel, and other exotic metals. Where necessary, procedures along with welders are “qualified” according to our quality control program. Whether you are taking advantage of our wire feed welders in our fabrication shop or utilizing our field crews and one of our over 200 welding units (4 packs, 6 packs, and singles), our QC program is second to none and you always know that your product is manufactured to the highest standards. Old fashioned attention to detail and dedication to our craft is the trademark of Wrigley Mechanical.

2,"Fabrication - Wrigley Mechanical Skip to main content Hit enter to search or ESC to close Close Search Menu Home Industrial Fabrication Heavy Commercial Service Design/Build About phone email FABRICATION Custom fabrication of piping, duct work, and structural steel of all materials. About Fabrication Custom fabrication of piping, duct work and structural steel of all materials began at Wrigley Mechanical, Inc. in a small shop over 25 years ago. The basis of the fabrication was to eliminate field hydro testing and bring the test into a controlled environment. What became of that first project was the vision and future of Wrigley Mechanical, Inc. Today our 28,000 square foot state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Fargo, N.D., is a success. All of the projects we participate in benefit from our shop. Accelerated production, onsite space considerations, critical path crashing, equipment delivery and control are just a few of the benefits of our fabrication shop, not to mention there are no rain days under our roof. In addition to all kinds of piping, we fabricate heavy ductwork, structural steel platforms, and many other custom weldments. Under the five overhead cranes (including two synchronized 10-ton that can carry large equipment from inside the plant to be loaded directly onto trucks outside), there are 16 jib cranes, and more than a dozen dual wire-feed welders. For each product working its way through the shop there are specialty tools including rollers, positioners, iron workers, plasma rigs, and torches to help it on its way. Wrigley has daily working relationships with many local laser and plasma cutters to facilitate the manufacture of smaller custom parts making our shop one of the most efficient in the upper Midwest. The materials sent to the shop are for the most part detailed by skilled auto CAD operators who know our business inside and out. In our fabrication shop the motto is: “If you can think it, we can build it.” TYPES OF FABRICATION Boiler Repair BOILER REPAIR One of the unique items we bring into our fabrication shop is boilers. Smaller boilers (usually less than 20,000 pounds), mobile boilers, and boilers to be relocated can have repairs done to them off site saving time, mobilization charges, and inspection fees. Many customers remove their smaller boilers in the summer for us to fix up and then reinstall them prior to the heating season. Give Bradley a call… he is ready! Piping PIPING Piping fabrication is the foundation of our fabrication facility. We are always ready for piping fabrication. From carbon steel to stainless, Corten to inconel, P11 to low temp applications, whether it is butt weld, socket weld, TIG, MIG, or stick, Wrigley can weld your piping to your specifications. Ductwork DUCTWORK Through over 5,000 projects we have completed since inception, Wrigley Mechanical has completed many large scale industrial ductwork projects. Pollution control requirements and combustion technology have driven many of our customers to modify existing or install complete new flue gas, combustion air, pulsing, and FGR systems. Wrigley is capable of 3D modeling and running these duct fabrications through to the end product. A recent project included a 13′ x 24′ x 40′ tall complete baghouse fabrication. Custom Structural Steel CUSTOM STRUCTURAL STEEL One of the most important features of a safe workplace is access. Wrigley Mechanical works with all of our customers to supply access to critical mechanical components at their place of business. Food facilities often require stainless or aluminum platforms and railing. Our fabrication shop regularly fabricates custom access platforms. Design services and PE stamping of structural drawings are available upon request. Contact Matt when you are ready for safer access. Asme ASME In the industrial field many custom ASME vessels are used in a wide variety of applications. Wrigley Mechanical is capable of design, manufacturing, and certification of new ASME vessels. In addition, in many cases it is cost effective to repair parts of existing vessels. Take advantage of our shop productivity and bring in your vessel by truck or train and we will repair it in our shop sending it back fully tested and certified.
