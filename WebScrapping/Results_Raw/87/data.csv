Our success and longevity is tied directly to the talent and dedication of people we are proud to say are the very best in the business. Starting as a small machine shop, a strategic partnership with Mosaic Capital Partners in 2016 gave us the resources we needed to meet increasing demand. That partnership led to our second 60,000 sq.ft facility in 2017 – the first still located in Winnipeg, Manitoba (CA) and the second located in West Fargo, North Dakota (US) to better serve our U.S. client base. Our combined abilities have created a metal manufacturing powerhouse that focuses on innovation, efficiency and personalized service to meet our customers’ needs. From day one we learned the importance of hard work, customer service and relationships. Today, we’re bigger, better and faster – but those same values drive us now more than ever as North America’s leading single source for custom welding, metal fabrication and manufacturing. Our Team Other companies may use similar processes and equipment – the same can be said of almost any industry. But it’s the people at Mackow who make us who we are and who deliver the very best products and services to our valued customers.
