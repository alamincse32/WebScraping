Fleet management today requires accurate tracking of fuel usage and inventory management. You can get very detailed, vehicle specific reporting of all of your fuel usage automatically with FuelMaster AIM2. No keys, cards or codes are required. Lubrication We design and install bulk fluid dispensing packages, fluid inventory and management systems, lubrication equipment, control handles, oil drains, and hose reels for equipment service shops and manufacturing plants. Bulk Fuel Plants We build bulk plants – from small to large – and we’re able to deliver turn-key builds at your site. We can deliver shop tanks up to 50,000 gallons in a single or double wall design. We also have loading arms for top and bottom loading, loading docks, metering, containment and controls to manage the products. Aircraft Fueling At O’Day Equipment, we have solutions for fueling light general aviation aircraft. We can deliver pre-engineered tanks, filtration and pumping systems for truck loading and/or aircraft fueling complete with automated fuel management and self-service controls. Our systems are customized and designed to manage expensive inventory and reduce operating costs. Data collection and inventory control are on the top of the list for most customers, and we have solutions to simplify these tasks. Farm Fueling During the 1950’s, a 300-gallon tank on a stand with a gravity transfer system was a modern fueling system on a farm. Today’s modern agriculture equipment has evolved, and so have the fueling systems on farms. We now provide a variety of tanks and transfer pumps up to 30,000 gallons to meet today’s agriculture equipment in single and double wall design. Power Generation Power generation systems that require long run times require fuel storage not integral to the generator system. At O’Day Equipment, we provide a complete installation of auxiliary fuel storage – above or underground – with any storage capacity needed.

O’Day started O’Day Equipment in 1935, he recognized that in order to be successful, he would need an organization that adds value to the equipment sold. He chose his suppliers carefully and gathered a team of professional and knowledgeable people to service customers. That same tradition continues today, and our team understands that our job is to solve problems for customers. For over 80 years, our focus has been to provide equipment and service for motor fueling systems. Whether it’s the nozzle that dispenses fuel, the hose, the pump, the storage tank or the actual point of sale inside the store, we believe that all aspects of the fuel exchange process are vital. But it doesn’t stop there. Fleet fueling, fuel management systems, aviation fueling, liquid storage tank maintenance, and experienced service technicians are also vital. Our goal is to be the first choice for service, sales, and support of petroleum equipment in the upper Midwest. The breadth of our offerings and geographical coverage area make O’Day Equipment the perfect choice for reaching business owners and servicing customers in a variety of locations. Strong vendor relationships based on mutual trust and business success are beneficial to what we’re able to do for our customers. Our vendors understand our commitment to service, and they work alongside us to solve our customers’ problems. Vendors like Gilbarco Veeder-Root provide constant innovation to increase profits with products such as SMART Merchandising and Applause. OPW exceeds industry standards with their quality line of fueling equipment. Our experience with steel fabrication at O’Day Tank & Steel means that we’re only limited by our creativity when customizing projects to match our customers’ needs. We value loyalty and are always working on improving relationships with our partners. O’Day Equipment is founded on a team of experienced and talented individuals who understand the importance of improving our business processes every day. Our team’s mission is to solve customers’ problems and help them make more money. We know that’s a tall order, and it requires people who are committed, enthusiastic, and aware. We work on continuous improvement programs to deliver better products and faster services – all while reducing our costs. We’re active in the advancement of our industry, and our team members are engaged in the leadership of regional and national trade associations. A benefit of these relationships is learning from other industry leaders and being on the cutting edge of technology, which allows us to constantly improve ourselves and our processes.
