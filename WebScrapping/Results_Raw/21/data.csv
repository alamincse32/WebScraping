Create an Account Banjo View All Banjo Products In 1959 Jack Canine's passion for solving problems with high quality products began in the garage of his Crawfordsville, Indiana home. He soon moved out of his garage and established Terra-Knife, a small supply company that provided fertilizer knives to farmers throughout the United States. As the agricultural industry continued to grow and the needs for new, innovative products were on the rise, Mr. Canine and his employees met this demand by introducing additional products to the Terra-Knife line, including ball valves and cam lever couplings. Shortly after, the company was renamed Terra-Products to better represent its broad product offerings. In keeping with Mr. Canine's entrepreneurial spirit, the engineering and manufacturing of new products continued throughout the years, leading to the service of new markets, including many industrial applications. Mr. Canine's personal hobby and love for the banjo, and the shape of the handle of one of the company's key products, the ball valve, led to the renaming of Terra-Products to Banjo Corporation.
