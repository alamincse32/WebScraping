The unique physical characteristics of a wide variety of materials provide a performance advantage in the rugged requirements of heavy equipment. Heavy Equipment Pain Points Wear Life Lubrication Reduction Corrosion & Abrasion Resistance Weight Reduction Wear Life The low coefficient of friction and inherent wear resistance of engineered plastics have proven to increase part life in demanding applications. These materials are also non-abrasive to mating surfaces, improving the wear life of the metallic components as well. Lubrication Reduction The sliding characteristics of engineered plastics and the enhanced surface lubricity offered by internal fillers can reduce or in some cases eliminate the need for additional lubrication. Corrosion & Abrasion Resistance Engineered plastics do not rust, they exhibit good UV resistance, and they are unaffected by a wide variety of chemicals. Abrasion resistance is also very good, enabling the materials to be used in extremely dirty environments. Weight Reduction Engineered plastics have an excellent strength to weight ratio, providing fuel economies, decreased compaction, and lower structural stress. Secondary Industries Agricultural Equipment Plastic parts have long been preferred over metal parts in the agriculture industry, where weight reduction and lubricity are the primary concern. Lighter weight plastic parts increase equipment’s fuel efficiency and ease of operation, and self-lubricating material eliminate the need to add grease and grime to the field. Plastics are also corrosion and shatter resistant, making them ideal for outdoor applications. Cope Plastics fabricates many different parts for tractors, harvesting equipment, implements, silage, and other types of agriculture equipment. Popular parts include wear pads, thrust washers, slider beds, bushings, windshields, and much more. Featured Parts:Wear Pads, Bed Liners, Kick Plates, Drag Flights, Hose Clamps, Skid Plates, Stump Plates, Chain Tensioners, Sprockets, Slider Beds, Hopper Liners, Conveyor Boards, Skylights, Windshields, Windows, Bushings, Bearings, Rollers, Guides, Gears, Impact Plates, Thrust Washers Spacers Plastic part used for Agricultural Equipment Reprocessed UHMW Hose Clamp Plastic part used for tractors Sleeve Bushing Plastic part used for agricultural equipment Wear Pad Plastic Part used for agricultural equipment Mining Equipment There aren’t many environments tougher than mining operations. Replacing metal parts with engineering plastics helps mitigate many of the common challenges mining professionals experience when it comes to safety and equipment operation. Plastics are self-lubricating, impact- and corrosion-resistant, and many materials exhibit a low coefficient of friction while performing exceptionally well under high pressure and at high rates of speed. When used in safety applications, plastics can even save miners’ lives through proximity alarming equipment (read our armor housings case study) and by preventing arching and rat-holing. At Cope, we partner with OEMs and tier 1 manufacturers of surface mining equipment, crushing equipment, screening equipment, conveyors, and more. Featured Parts: Wear Pads, Bed Liners, Railcar Liners, Kick Plates, Drag Flights, Hose Clamps, Skid Plates, Chain Tensioners, Sprockets, Pulleys, Slider Beds, Hopper Liners, Conveyor Boards, Skylights, Windshields, Windows, Bushings, Bearings, Rollers, Guides, Gears, Impact Plates, Thrust Washers, Armor Housings Nylon Roller Plastic part used for mining equipment Lubricant Filled Nylon Bushing Plastic part used for mining equipment Nylon Shoulder Bushing Plastic part used for mining equipment Construction & Utility Equipment The corrosion resistance, high strength, light weight, and dimensional stability of engineering plastic materials such as HDPE, nylon, PET, and UHMW (among others) make them ideal for use in construction and utility equipment. Engineering plastics wear parts preserve the life of expensive machined mating parts, and perhaps even more importantly, they can prevent your equipment from exerting harmful effects on the environment. Because plastics are self-lubricating, they eliminate the need for oil-based lubricants that can leak and contaminate groundwater. According to the EPA, groundwater is the primary source for more than 80% of community drinking water in the United States…and just one gallon of refined oil lubricant can contaminate 100,000 gallons of groundwater.

Cope’s Marketing Manager, Jenni Wittman Recycling Program Why is it important to recycle plastics? To help conserve non-renewable natural resources, save energy, mitigate global warming and pollution, reduce landfill waste, meet global demands, create new job sectors and economic growth, be proactive to governmental regulations, lessen costs of goods, be socially and environmentally responsible, and to preserve our planet—we only have one! How do performance plastics get recycled? Through reprocessing companies, many performance plastics are pelletized, ground, washed, compounded, sorted, and packaged to be used as an economically viable alternative to virgin resin or pellets and made into new products. How can I better ensure that my scrap performance plastics are desirable? Keeping different material types sorted and labeled is important, as well as storing scrap indoors and avoiding potential contaminants like machine chip, wood and metal debris, dirt, oil, hardware, and vinyl graphics as they may all downgrade recyclability. Masking is acceptable on most materials but may also reduce appeal. Does demand for performance plastics vary depending on material type? Yes. Similar to metal markets, there is a broad range of desirability and marketability for polymer materials. Types that are recycled domestically into electronic housings, such as polycarbonate and ABS, are in high demand, while those that are difficult or dangerous to reprocess, like PVC and acetal, are not. Can performance and engineering plastics be considered sustainable or environmentally-friendly? Yes! In order for a product or material to be truly described as sustainable, it must be environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. Plastics make an immense contribution to environmental sustainability through their energy-saving potential, intrinsic recyclability, and energy recovery options. Economically, plastics form an important part of the global economy. Socially the plastics industry is a major and inclusive employer with attention to training and education. Performance plastics are designed for multi-use applications and offer unique opportunities to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Do you accept post-consumer recyclable materials like milk jugs and soda bottles? No. Cope focuses on reclaiming post-industrial performance plastic scrap generated through internal fabrication and from our distribution customers. For recycling of single-use plastics, please investigate local options available from Republic Services, Allied Waste, Waste Management, or similar companies who offer pick-up and drop-off services. You can also check Where to Recycle on earth911.com. Is your recycling center open to the public? No, our recycling program is for Cope Plastics customers only. However, we do host community recycling events from time to time! Follow us on social media to hear about our next event. I’m a plastics fabricator looking to recycle off-fall material. Who can I contact? Reach out to Cope’s Environmental Manager, Jama Fabry, via the contact form on our Recycling Program Page. Student Groups Do you offer tours for students? We do! Contact Dan Coffman at (618) 467-7360 for more information about bringing your student group to Cope Plastics. For maximum learning experience, small groups of 10 or less are ideal, but we can accommodate larger groups with plenty of notice. What’s the minimum age for student group tours?

Featured Parts: Trade Show and Museum Exhibits, Indoor and Outdoor 2D and 3D Signage, Retail Racks, Tiered Tables, Short-term and Long-term Promotional Displays and Signs clear acrylic POP display cases acrylic two-tiered display stand translucent white outdoor signage frosted acrylic 4-way retail display acrylic sign Building & Architectural Advanced architectural plastics are making applications safer and more environmentally friendly. The durability, strength, and weather resistance of plastics such as acrylic, polycarbonate, ACM, and HDPE create long lasting structures for greenhouses, bus shelters, canopies, and more. These materials are lighter weight than wood, metal, and glass, making them easier to handle during installation, requiring less fuel and energy to transport, and providing fewer maintenance concerns over the life of the structure. Featured Parts: Greenhouses, Entryway Canopies, Bus Shelters, Carports, Sloped & Curved Glazing, Skylights, Security Windows, Interior Partitions, Room Dividers, Lighting Lenses, Mirrors, Corner Guards, Run Rails, Outdoor Furniture, Playgrounds colored polycarbonate carport acrylic and polycarbonate bus shelter HDPE and polycarbonate playground equipment translucent room dividers vacuum formed skylights Construction & Glazing Plastics play an important role in the process of any construction project…not only in the finished building, but also in keeping the workplace operating efficiently and safely. To avoid accidents and control movement on the job site, directional and construction signage made from durable plastic is both highly visible and cost-effective. For glazing applications, the flexibility and shatter resistance of plastics like polycarbonate make it an ideal alternative to traditional glass while meeting OSHA requirements. Featured Parts: Cab windows, Directional Signage, Construction Signage, Clear Partitions/Barriers, Boarding Windows, Floor Protection Mats (Surface Shields) construction equipment protective cab windows clear driver safety panels for forklifts construction site safety signage Transportation Plastics can make trains, buses, boats, planes, ATVs, and RVs safer, more comfortable, and more fuel-efficient thanks to their durability and decreased weight. In the event of a collision, some polymers are impact- and fire-resistant, which better protects passengers and drivers. For everyday comfort, plastics can also provide sound dampening effects, which provides a more pleasant experience for passengers and commuters. Plastics can also provide clear communication and attractive interiors inside commuter vehicles due to the wide variety of colors and graphics capabilities. Additionally, plastics can be manipulated in many ways to create complex fabricated or thermoformed parts. Featured Parts: DOT Signage, Bus (Mobile & Shelter) Signs, Transportation Windows, Window Graphics, Folding Trays, Wall Panels, Driver Security Glazing Bus Driver Clear Barrier ATV windows airline windows Safety & Security Polymers can be highly effective in protecting people from natural disasters and attacks from physical assault, bullets, and bomb blasts. Fabricated plastics can be used in wearable armor and safety barriers. Unlike glass, plastics have the ability to absorb shock by converting the energy of an impact into heat, which allows the polymer material to bend rather than shatter. Security plastic is also more energy efficient than safety glass, so when used for barriers such as bank windows and detention center glazing, it can lower the business or institution’s carbon footprint. Featured Parts: Safety & Emergency Signs, Bank Windows, Convenience Store/Gas Cashier Glazing, Embassy Windows, Military/Police Face Shields, Prison/Detention Center Glazing, Riot Shields, Weather Rated Windows, Security Entryways, Machine Guards Acrylic Retail Barrier Acrylic Tabletop Barrier bank security barriers bullet resistant glazed polycarbonate Packaging With its light weight, excellent barrier qualities, and FDA compliance, plastic is an ideal alternative to cardboard for food, beverage, and other consumer products. Plastic packaging maintains the integrity of the products it protects and keeps consumers safe from potential contaminants that may be encountered during transport and within retail environments. Plastic packaging also contributes to a closed-loop supply chain since it is highly recyclable and does not require tape or adhesive.
