We also provide custom packaging solutions to fit your needs and desires. Roasting requires a balance of science and art. SunGold Foods continues to use science to take roasting to the next level. The science behind our roasting lines provides a continuous flow of product, resulting in lower deviations in finished goods, and creating higher consumer satisfaction and enjoyment. We use science-based equipment to test moisture, color and salt levels, to set and achieve customer expectations and specifications. Agricultural commodities do have natural fluctuations, so there is an undeniable art to roasting that requires human expertise. Our Master Roasters ensure that all products meet each specific customer’s taste, texture and visual requirements. We can roast products via frying or drying. In the oil frying process, we use NuSun sunflower oil, which is a trans-fat-free oil with low to no flavor characteristic that allows the actual product flavors to shine through. Dry roasting can be done in several different manners that will provide different characteristics and flavor profiles to your products; the result is a product with a uniqueness that is all your own. Want flavors? We work with our clients to develop flavors that carry through to consumer continual satisfaction. Using classic methods of flavoring and always looking at new methods, we can find the right fit for you and your consumer. Need proprietary or exclusive pre-blends? We’ll collaborate with you, then send the ready-to-use product right to your facilities. Need strictly peanut- and tree nut-free ingredients? We are a completely nut-free facility.
