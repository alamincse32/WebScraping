Not unlike commercial offset or digital printing, label printing requires the same approach to preparing your files to have them pint correctly. These five essential tips will help to make your labels print more efficiently and keep you project on track. Color: Convert all you colors to CMYK unless you specifically want to use a PMS spot color. Doing so will give you a more accurate view of your color spectrum versus if you if you have designed your label in spot colors or RGB colors. Bleeds: 1/16″ to 1/8″ is necessary if you want to bleed off the edge. Fonts: Outline fonts is the best practice here, providing font is ok too but outlined text is preferred. Margins: Leaving 1/8″ is the bare minimum – especially for type. 1/4″ is best. File size: Anything over 50mb is going to cause problems. Flatten artwork and submit final files as a high quality Illustrator or PDF print file. For further information and templates on file prep, visit our learning page here. http://northernplainslabel.com/learning/ Bonus tip: Barcodes – If you label requires a barcode, make it a 100% black vector file with a 0.001 white rule around the actual bare code lines.
