Our heavy equipment rental lineup includes more than 40 different categories of attachments for agriculture, construction, demolition, earthmoving, forestry, landscaping, mining, paving, power, recycling and waste applications — with dozens of options within each to fit your needs.

WE FEATURE CAT WORK TOOL RENTALS As part of the vast Cat family and dealer network, The Cat Rental Store carries a full assortment of attachments that are compatible with Cat products. These are typically low-hour units featuring the most advanced technologies available from the worldwide heavy equipment leader. When used with Cat machines equipped with quick couplers, your operators can make fast, easy attachment changes. In most cases, they won't need to leave the cab. Operators can exchange attachments with a simple three-step process. First, the operator typically tilts the front plate forward, hooks it under the attachment and then lifts the attachment off the ground to rest it in place. Then, the operator locks the couplers by pressing a button in the cab or manually performing the action. The last step is to connect the hydraulic hose by lining up the hose with the port and pressing it into place. The Cat Rental Store provides premium machines with easy mix-and-match attachments to save your team time on the job site. With Cat work tool rentals to expand your capabilities, you can focus on what matters — delivering top performance for your business.

Start Shopping ­ Hydraulics are the muscles of your machine making the connection between machine power and job productivity. Our machines are designed for the toughest applications and our hydraulic components are built to meet those requirements. They’re built to meet the exact specs of Cat® equipment — from power and responsiveness to breakout force and speed. Did you know that hydraulic components are highly sensitive to contamination? 75-85% of hydraulic system failures are traced to contamination issues.* Simply keeping your hydraulic fluid clean through smart contamination control can significantly reduce hydraulic system failures and repair or replacement costs. Specialized equipment and expertise are necessary to keep your machines working at peak performance. Since a well-maintained hydraulic system is essential to your Cat machine's performance and life, regular service from a Cat dealer will help lower your operating costs and increase uptime with confidence. Whether you own one machine or a fleet of hundreds, Cat hydraulic system components are the right choice to increase your profits and savings. *According to industry standards DISCUSS HYDRAULICS WITH YOUR CAT DEALER CONTACT YOUR CAT DEALER warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of HYDRAULIC PUMPS & MOTORS Precisely matched to your machine specs, Cat pumps and motors protect your productivity and profits.

It minimizes our downtime and increases our profitability.” Chris Olson, President, OE Construction 9 out of 10 Cat® machines sold in North America include an Equipment Protection Plan (source: Cat Financial, 2009) 100+ machines components protected beyond the warranty by a Premier plan Up to $1B worth of construction equipment stolen each year (source: National Equipment Register, 2016) Cat Extended Protection Extended Protection for Machines Equipment Protection Plans (EPP) Even the best-built machines eventually need repairs, which always seem to happen at the worst time — right in the middle of a big job, when cash is tight or just after the warranty expires. An Equipment Protection Plan (EPP) for a new, used or rebuilt machine: Provides coverage beyond standard machine warranty for parts and labor, and protects you from unplanned repair costs from covered defects in Cat material and manufacturer workmanship Offers multiple coverage options to fit your needs and budget Includes genuine Cat parts and service performed by factory-trained dealer technicians Transfers with the machine when you sell it in the same region the EPP was purchased Extended Protection for Gensets and Engines Extended Service Coverage (ESC) Perhaps more than any other type of equipment, gensets and engines have to run reliably. You, and the people relying on you, can’t afford downtime.

Our services leverage connected product data to provide actionable information that you can use to improve your operations and, ultimately, your profitability. We understand that you want to know how these equipment technologies and services can deliver benefits to you while respecting your information. These connected product data principles, together with Caterpillar’s Data Governance Statement (available at www.cat.com/data_governance_statement) explain Caterpillar’s information management guidelines for connected product data.

For example, we may share your data with our business partners to enable delivery of Caterpillar value added services and products to you, or engage third parties to process data on Caterpillar’s behalf. Regardless of who processes the data, Caterpillar will be responsible for your information. Your information may also be used in benchmarking reports to allow comparisons across fleets/equipment data within an industry. Benchmarking reports will not include personally identifiable information.

Safety is no longer a burden but a benefit, supported and cherished by all levels from the front line to the boardroom. What is a safety culture? A true safety culture is where safety practices are embedded across an organization, where safety is approached pro-actively and all team members accept ownership of safety. It goes beyond safety fundamentals, where safety responsibility is assigned to specific individuals, to a culture where safety behaviors are demonstrated by every employee across the entire organization. A safety culture takes some time to develop and embed, but organizations who succeed are rewarded with improved engagement, reduction in incident rates, and increased productivity. Contact Us Contact Us What does an organization with a strong safety culture look like? Safety roles and responsibilities are assigned across the organization, with employees at all levels taking ownership of safety. Management is visibly committed to initiatives. All employees are empowered to contribute to the safety conversation and speak openly about observed risks. A long-term safety strategy is in place, with representation and accountability at all levels. The Safety Department is viewed as a valuable resource, not the sole owner of safety, since responsibility for safety is shared across the organization. Safety culture or leadership data is analyzed to determine trends and support strategic decision-making. Four ways to know if you have a true safety culture ALL EMPLOYEES ENGAGED The conversation around safety is a positive part of everyday work. EMBEDDED ACCOUNTABILITIES Safety is owned at every level and everyone understands what they are accountable for - from the leadership to the front line. ORGANIZATIONAL ADOPTION Best-practice safety processes are adopted at all stages of production, and a system of continual improvement. LEADER COMMUNICATION Safety is a key part of the business conversation, embedded into company-wide communications.

Enable leaders to identify gaps and develop a plan for improvement that generates visible results. About the Safety Leadership Assessment Contact Us Contact Us When organizations are striving to develop and sustain a culture of safety excellence, leadership words and behaviors influence employees’ attitudes, beliefs and ideas about safety. Research shows it takes four key leadership skills to inspire a positive safety culture that influences safe employee behavior. The Safety Leadership Assessment is a statistically validated instrument designed to help you assess those essential safety leadership skills, utilize quantifiable data, and appropriately develop leadership to inspire a culture of safety excellence in your organization. After more than five years of research and collaboration from behavioral assessment experts, Development Dimensions International (DDI), Caterpillar has developed the Safety Leadership Assessment to assess key leadership attributes that, when demonstrated with a high degree, will positively influence employee safety behavior. The Safety Leadership Assessment provides individual supervisors and managers a measurement of their leadership capability from those who regularly observe the leader’s behavior: their direct reports. Participants rate statements on a 5-point Likert scale. The assessment will determine where leaders score within the four primary safety leadership domains: trust, accountability, connectedness and credible consciousness. Within the four domains are 14 elements that influence an individual leader’s effectiveness. Once validated, organizations will be able to correlate a leader’s actions to the true presence of safety in the field to answer the critical question, “Am I leading in such a way that I am creating a safer place to work for my employees?” Key Facts Who's it for? Anyone with direct reports. Why do it? Assess safety leadership skills and identify development needs for each individual. Format Assessment surveys, followed by results data, an overall leadership report and then individualized action plans. Outcomes Accurate assessment of leadership performance in the four domains of safety leadership. Identification of gaps in safety leadership. Creation of individual development plans for leadership. Take a Sample Assessment ""SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS CAN SEE HOW THEIR TEAM ASSESSED THEM ON INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS, SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO WORK ON TO IMPROVE, OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING WELL AND SHOULD CONTINUE. AFTER IMPLEMENTING A SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT PLAN THEY CAN RE-SURVEY THEIR EMPLOYEES ON SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO SEE IF THEIR EFFORTS WERE SUCCESSFUL. THIS IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO HELP LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ALL FORMS OF LEADERSHIP, NOT JUST SAFETY.""

Utilizing Cat MineStar to its full potential can help enhance safety, reduce costs, improve productivity and boost efficiency. That’s why the MineStar team provides a comprehensive suite of training opportunities that allows users to build skills from foundational to advanced through web-based, instructor-led (virtual or in-person), virtual reality, and on-the-job courses. Training is based on mine site and dealership job roles, ensuring users are trained to be effective and efficient in their daily work. Training spans the MineStar suite of products—Fleet, Terrain, Detect, Health, and Command—and can be scheduled in combination or individually to allow your operations the flexibility and scalability needed to be more productive, efficient and safe. warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Types of training Web-Based Training Also called eLearning, this method is the most portable and allows users to learn via videos, interactive digital courses and other media types on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Web-based training is usually foundational-level content. Instructor-Led Training Instructor-led courses allow users to learn with others in a classroom environment with a subject matter expert and standardized materials. Our instructor-led training consists of interactive system exercises to equip users for real-world application of the products. Simulation Simulation training takes the classroom one step further and allows users to apply hands-on learning in an environment that mimics mine control operations. This type of instruction allows users to make mistakes and learn the system without having a negative impact on production. Virtual Reality VR technology takes training to the next level by immersing learners in a realistic simulated environment which can be set up in any safe and convenient location. VR training minimizes the amount of time equipment is pulled from production for use in training without sacrificing a learner’s ability to learn through hands-on methods. On-The-Job / Practical To gain familiarity with site specific procedures, we encourage on-the-job shadowing after completing training so that users can apply what they’ve learned to real-world applications at their site.

By Caterpillar Published: Sep 01, 2023 Since the pandemic, there has been a significant rise in the theft of machines in South Africa. Still, for Pentacon Plant PTY LTD, prompt action, a determined investigator, and new technology meant they would recover the machine in a matter of days. When thieves crept onto a construction site in Tafelkop Limpopo, South Africa, disarmed the tracking unit from a Cat® and loaded it onto a rollback they probably thought they’d done enough to make a successful getaway. Unfortunately for them, the machine was connected to the latest version of VisionLink®, through the support of their local Cat dealer. As soon as the theft was discovered Jaco du Plessis, Product Manager at Barloworld Equipment, received a call from Tyron Gardiner of Tradelog Investigation Services. Tyron, who specializes in tracking down plant and machinery, knew that if he was lucky, additional data might be available from the machine at the dealership. And if so, there was a chance that the insurers could avoid having to pay out on the $80,000 claim. While not intended as an anti-theft device, VisionLink has proved to be very effective in the past. Jaco du Plessis Product Manager Barloworld Equipment A call to Jaco confirmed it was fitted with VisionLink. “We were then able to go into our dealer service portal and change the subscription on the machine to update every 10 minutes instead of the once-a-day subscription the customer had in place.” This now allowed them to track the machine. As they plotted its movements, they noticed that it would stop at night, and then every morning, around 2 am, the machine would begin moving again. However, after three days and over 500km, the Cat backhoe loader arrived in Newcastle, where it stayed put. This gave the South African Police Flying Squad the opportunity they needed, with VisionLink giving them the exact coordinates of a warehouse. Inside of which was the backhoe loader. warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Jaco couldn’t be more pleased, “With theft of machines increasingly on the rise, it is good to know that we have a secret weapon that’s helping us to beat the thieves.” The machine is none the worse for its adventure and is safely back with its rightful owner. Since then, Jaco and Tyron have worked together on recovering two more stolen Cat Backhoe Loaders.

Cat Financial Cat Financial Toggle link Special Offers Cat Card Finance Equipment Protection & Insurance About Us What Is Equipment Financing and How Does It Work? Financing Basics How to Apply Equipment Maintenance Request Financing Information Request Financing Information Financing Basics How to Apply Equipment Maintenance It's important to understand the options you have to acquire equipment for businesses like yours that rely on heavy equipment to get the job done. Whether you need to purchase your first machine, replace an aging machine, or expand your fleet, heavy equipment is a significant investment for your business. And, there are several ways to get the equipment you need and within your budget. Before you get started, it's best to evaluate your equipment needs to ensure you choose the best option for your business. Cat Financial offers flexible equipment financing and leasing options to make equipment more affordable and to help preserve your cash flow. Our financial options are developed specifically for Cat® customers and the unique needs of your business. Learn more about equipment financing below to ensure you're prepared when you're ready to acquire equipment. THE BASICS OF EQUIPMENT FINANCING When it's time to acquire Cat® equipment, you generally have the option to pay in cash, finance with a loan, lease, or rent. Each option can offer many benefits for your business depending on your long or short-term equipment needs. Learn more about heavy equipment financing options. Financing equipment can be a great option if you're not interested in paying cash for equipment. Equipment financing enables you to get a loan to purchase heavy machinery without paying in full in one transaction. Instead, a heavy equipment loan allows qualified customers to spread the full cost out with monthly payments over a negotiated period of time. Equipment financing is different from capital loan because equipment loans can only be used to acquire equipment. Typically, loan payments include the price of the machine as well as interest. The equipment you're buying with the loan serves as collateral. Should you default on the loan, the lender has the right to repossess the asset so they can resell it and recoup the remaining loan amount. As a result, equipment financing can be more cost-effective and less risky than other forms of financing to acquire heavy equipment. Financing heavy equipment can present many benefits for your business including: A great solution for long-term equipment needs Build equity through ownership You own the equipment once all payments have been made Free up cash for other business needs Competitive rates and terms from Cat Financial Special offers may be available to help you save Flexible payment schedules for qualified customers Note: All customers are subject to credit approval with Cat Financial. Not all customers will qualify. Contact your local Cat dealer for details. Compare your equipment financing options using this side by side comparison chart. To help you make the right decision for your business, consider these factors: How Long Do You Need the Equipment? The first thing to consider before financing equipment is how long you will need equipment. Some machinery can be used for most of your projects, while others are only needed for a specific application or to complete a certain task. Understanding the scope of work can help you determine how long you will need equipment. Financing equipment is a great option for long-term equipment needs as it allows you to own the equipment once all loan payments are complete. Financing heavy equipment allows you to preserve your cash flow and offers many benefits to businesses with long-term equipment needs. Alternatively, leasing or renting equipment are great options for short-term equipment needs as they allow you to use the equipment for an amount of time and return it when you're finished with it or the lease ends. How Much Can You Afford? You'll also want to consider your budget, which can influence the type of equipment you choose and how you acquire it. Financing equipment is usually more costly than leasing or renting as it usually includes an interest rate - a fee for borrowing money. Limited-time special offers can help reduce the interest and save you money. View special offers Leasing and renting equipment are typically more cost-effective because you're paying for the use and the cost of depreciation for the equipment and not the full price of the machine. Note that leasing can have higher long-term costs since you're not paying a principal value. Learn more about the many benefits of equipment leasing How to Find the Right Lender to Finance Equipment? Choosing the right lender is important especially for businesses that rely on heavy equipment. Traditional banks and financial institutions have their strengths, but at Cat Financial, our team of experts knows your equipment and the challenges your industry can face. We're committed to the success of your business. And if you've been impacted by a natural disaster or economic downtown, we're here to help you through it.

Together, we can guide you through the process. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU FINANCE? You can finance more than heavy equipment, such as maintenance, protection plans and physical damage insurance. Below, you'll learn more about the different things you can finance through Cat Financial. Preventive Maintenance Plans for Heavy Equipment We understand equipment downtime can impact your bottom line. Preventative maintenance can help keep your equipment working on the job site longer and extend the life of your equipment. The Cat Customer Value Agreement (CVA) by Cat Financial can be packaged with your machine payment and provides you with a preventative maintenance parts kit with everything you need to keep your Cat machine running at peak performance including: Manage costs by locking in your preventative maintenance costs for the length of your contract. The right genuine Cat parts delivered in 500-hour intervals through the life of your CVA and backed by the standard Caterpillar parts warranty. Cat filters capture harmful particles and keep systems clean and Cat fluids* lubricate critical components to protect system performance. Cat® Equipment Management subscription with a dedicated team monitoring machine hours and location. Cat digital services also make it easy for you to monitor your machine location, hours and fuel level from your desktop or mobile device. Routine S•O•SSM** and analysis helps minimize operating costs and extend the lifespan of machine components. Inspect your way to better productivity with Cat Inspect. It's simple to set up, easy to use and integrates with your other Cat data systems. *only included with Cat CVA inclusive of labor - available to upgrade at time of purchase or time of service ** S•O•SSM is not included with every CVA. Ask your local dealer for a CVA inclusive of S•O•SSM Equipment Protection Plans for Heavy Equipment Even the best built machines will eventually require repairs. An Equipment Protection Plan (EPP) provide coverage beyond the standard machine warranty and protect against unplanned repair costs and defects covered in Cat manufacturer workmanship and materials. Choose from multiple levels of coverage to meet your business needs. You can also transfer the machine when you sell it within the same region the EPP was purchased. An EPP can also be packaged with your machine for one monthly payment for simplified budgeting. Physical Damage Insurance for Heavy Equipment On top of preventive maintenance plans and EPPs, you can also choose physical damage insurance. This insurance covers partial and total equipment losses from floods, fires, vandalism, theft and collision. There's a lot that can happen to your equipment you can't control, which is why you have the option to add Physical Damage Insurance.

Considerations When Deciding to Repair, Replace or Rebuild 2023-10-25 Should you repair, rebuild or replace Cat equipment? A machine rebuild offers distinct advantages over repair — and is less expensive than replacement. Let’s review the pros and cons of repair, rebuild and replace. callFind Out the Pros and Cons FAQs We know that every equipment decision impacts your bottom line. Good decisions start with the right information. Here are answers to common questions about remanufacturing, rebuilds, upgrades and repair options. Contact your local Cat dealer to get an expert assessment of your specific needs and learn about your best options. What are the key differences between rebuilt and remanufactured? Caterpillar’s remanufacturing and rebuild options are both cost-effective and sustainable options to get the Cat equipment you need at a lower cost. But they are different. Rebuild: Rebuilds are completed at a Cat dealer, Cat dealer technicians perform a major repair on your machine by: Cleaning, reconditioning or repairing every major component and system and replacing minor components and parts Restoring the interior and exterior Adding upgraded features (if requested) Remanufacturing: Cat Reman remanufactures engines and parts at our state-of-the-art Cat Reman remanufacturing facilities. Cat Reman specialists disassemble and re-machine every part, engine or system. The part, engine or system is restored to like-new condition and assembled into a new product Reman engines and components receive a new serial number and the same standard Caterpillar Limited Warranty as our new products. You can purchase Cat Reman engines and components through your Cat dealer. warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of 101: What are the definitions of heavy equipment maintenance, repairs, rebuilds, upgrades and remanufacturing? Equipment Maintenance is the routine work that keeps your machine, genset or engine running with minimal downtime. It includes (but is not limited to) scheduled checks, routine inspections, regular replacement of worn parts and fluids, alignments and system cleanings. See Maintenance resources. Equipment Repairs are like equipment maintenance but usually are done in response to a failure or damage, such as a broken part. Repairs can be minor, such as a broken pin, or major, like a hydraulic repair. Regular maintenance can reduce the need for repairs. Upgrades: Upgrades may be machine features that were available (but not purchased) when the equipment was new. Or they can be features introduced on more recent models (which were not available when the equipment was new). Upgrades may also be in the form of a Repower, which involves replacing the engine in older machines with a newer tier levels engine. We design upgrades to revitalize customer machinery, extend useful life, boost profit, enhance company image, improve operator satisfaction, and increase reliability / uptime. Machine rebuilds are like machine renovations. A machine rebuild returns your machine to like, or better-than-when new condition. A machine rebuild involves reconditioning and / oror replacing major and minor systems and components of the machine, system recalibration, and cosmetic and cab restoration. And, if you choose, a rebuild can include upgrades of things like technology, cab interiors and more. Remanufacturing is the process of tearing down an engine or major component, restoring all the pieces and reassembling the reconditioned components into an entirely new product. Overhaul isn’t a technical term, but many use it as another word for a rebuild. Machine Refurbishment is another term to describe a machine rebuild. Although we at Caterpillar don’t use thate term, the meaning is the same. It is a total renovation of your machine that returns it to like or better than new condition. Machine Restoration is the process of returning a machine to its original condition, usually using original OEM systems and components. It’s often used in the context of antique Cat machines. Can you repair while you upgrade and vice versa? Yes. Your Cat dealer can show you upgrade options available for your machine when you discuss upcoming repair needs. Can I upgrade my machine when I rebuild? Many people choose to add or upgrade features on their Cat machine during a rebuild. A rebuild is a great time to add technology, performance upgrades and comforts that were unavailable when your machine was originally manufactured. What is the difference between maintenance and repairs? While maintenance is usually planned, repairs are reactive service work. Maintenance is the proactive, routine work done to keep a machine or engine working well. Repairs are done to fix something that’s already broken or not working right. Can I repair or upgrade Cat equipment myself? Caterpillar does not restrict who can repair, maintain or upgrade your Cat equipment. You can do many repairs and upgrades to your Cat equipment yourself. In fact, our SIS2GO app empowers you to do repairs and maintenance yourself with detailed machine and engine information direct from Caterpillar on your phone.​ We offer repair kits, upgrade kits, manuals and other resources for people who prefer to DIY. However, most major repairs and upgrades are best done by Cat dealer technicians who have the proper tools and expertise to do them right. Can I rebuild a Cat machine by myself? Technically, yes—some people may have the tools and knowledge to rebuild a machine on their own. However, most don’t have the time or resources to do it themselves. Can I finance an equipment rebuild or major repair? Yes. Cat Financial has many financing options for equipment rebuilds and major repairs. Your local Cat dealer can help you find best option for you. You can learn more about the cost of rebuilding a machine here.

We bring the value at the core of every Cat product back to life, so you can reduce waste, lower your total cost of ownership, and extend the value of your product investment. Service Offerings Cat equipment and Cat Reman go hand-in-hand from the time you purchase your product through maintenance, repair, rebuild and overhaul. When you return your used Cat component to your dealer, Cat Reman salvages, reengineers and remanufactures it using state-of-the-art processes and technologies to recapture and renew its built-in quality and performance. Our broad portfolio of replacement parts, available from your Cat dealer, provide same-as-when-new performance and durability at a price that is an average of 40% less than an equivalent new part. Cat Reman parts are the dealer and customer choice for consistently high-quality, affordable, readily available replacement parts. Why Cat Reman We help you cut costs without cutting corners. Unlike regional competitors, Cat Reman parts are made from genuine Cat materials and are backed by the same warranty as new Cat parts. We offer more than 7600 Cat Reman products, all available off-the-shelf from your Cat dealer. Trust is at the core of Cat Reman. Our decades of remanufacturing experience mean our genuine Cat replacement products meet the same exacting specifications as when they were new, and incorporate the latest engineering updates, so you can be sure you are getting the performance and durability you expect from Cat. We are committed to helping you do more work with less waste. Cat Reman products are designed to help you waste less time and money on maintenance and get more value out of your product investment. Remanufacturing also helps keep high-value raw materials (iron) in productive use and helps extend the value of the non-renewable resources (energy, water) consumed in a component’s original manufacture. We aren’t just reman, we’re Cat Reman. warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Visit Cat.com warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Industries: Construction, Resource, Energy and Transportation warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Countries of Use: Global warning Multimedia Cookies are required To watch videos, click on the Cookie Settings link and accept Targeting cookies Cookie Settings of Distribution Channels: Cat Dealers Make the Difference Find your Dealer Need to use Caterpillar's Logos, photos, video footage or technical materials?

THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THESE TERMS OF USE. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Chief Legal Officer, Caterpillar Inc., 5205 N. O'Connor Boulevard, Suite 100, Irving, TX 75039. The arbitration will take place in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures. Your request for arbitration must be post marked within the time period specified above under ""Contractual Statute of Limitations."" In no event shall demand for arbitration be made or permitted after the date when the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT YOU OR WE MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The arbitration panel shall consist of one individual appointed by Caterpillar and you. Such individual shall (i) have been selected from the AAA's list of potential arbitrators, (ii) have at least 10 years of experience in the discipline which is the subject of the dispute, and (iii) be an attorney whose 10 years of experience has been in the realm of litigating and arbitrating issues which are of the subject of the dispute. If Caterpillar and you fail to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within 15 business days after receipt of the request to arbitrate, then the arbitration panel shall be selected by the administrative office of the AAA. Such office shall, within five days after notice by any party to these Terms of Use, select a single arbitrator who complies with the requirements otherwise set forth in this paragraph. The arbitrator shall render its decision as soon as reasonably possible after its appointment and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use. This agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any decision rendered by the arbitrator pursuant to any arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment may be entered upon in in accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing party in any arbitration or court proceedings shall be reimbursed by the other party for all costs, expenses and charges, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the prevailing party. Choice of Law; Severability These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A. (regardless of the laws that might be applicable under its principles of conflict of laws). Each party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that place. If any provision of these Terms of Use, or the application thereof, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of these Terms of Use, all of which shall remain in full force and effect, and such other provisions will be interpreted so as best to reasonably effect the intent of the parties. The parties further agree to replace any such invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision designed to achieve, to the extent possible under applicable law, the business purpose and intent of such invalid or unenforceable provision. The laws of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. We recognize that it is possible for you to obtain access to any Sites from any jurisdiction in the world, but we have no practical ability to prevent such access.

You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with them. Entire Agreement These Terms of Use (including, to the extent applicable, any additional terms and conditions for any particular Networked Site and any end user license agreement for any associated software, including mobile applications) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Sites and Content and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The terms and conditions of any quotation, offer, acknowledgement, invoice, or similar document, however designated, directly or indirectly made or issued by you shall not apply. Severability If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then such provision shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Waiver No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder.

You may not assign or delegate your rights or obligations without prior written consent of Caterpillar, which may be withheld at our sole discretion.
