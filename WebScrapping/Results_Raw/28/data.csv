It follows in the proud tradition of a family that has been involved in the manufacturing business in North Dakota for more than 50 years. Howard and Brian Dahl, the founders of Amity are grandsons of E. G. Melroe, the founder of the Melroe Company which developed the Bobcat Loader. After the company was sold in 1970, Eugene Dahl and his brother-in-law, Les Melroe, bought control of Steiger Tractor. It became the leading manufacturer of 4 wheel drive tractors in the world, and was sold to Case Corporation in 1986. Howard and Brian Dahl incorporated Concord, Inc., which became the leading manufacturer in the United States of Air Drills, used primarily for the planting of small grains and oil seed crops on large acreage. Concord had a particularly strong market in the CIS (former Soviet Union) and sold over 500 Concord Air Drills into that marketplace. The Concord company was sold to Case Corporation in 1996. Case did not purchase all the assets of Concord and those assets were used to launch Amity Technology. The heart of Amity Technology has been the WIC Sugar Beet Equipment line, the leader in North America in harvesting equipment for sugar beets. WIC equipment is found in a number of Eastern European countries as well. Amity Technology has had a particularly strong presence in Russia. In 2001, Amity Technology became involved in the tillage business by purchasing, with other partners, Wil-Rich, a Wahpeton, ND-based company that had a reputation for building robust tillage tools, including field cultivators and chisel plows. The Wishek line of heavy, durable disc harrows was added to the equipment line in 2006. In the summer of 2007, Amity Technology returned to its roots and entered the air seeding business once again through the acquisition of Fargo Products, a company that developed a very successful air double disc drill along with stainless steel air carts. With more than 30 years in the air seeding business, Amity introduced the Single Disc Drill in 2008 – the first new drill technology in 20 years. In 2011, Amity Technology entered into a joint venture with AGCO for the development and distribution of air seeding and tillage equipment. AGCO-Amity JV, LLC, developed and distributed air seeding and tillage equipment under the Amity, Concord, Wil-Rich, and Wishek brands, as well as Challenger, Sunflower, and Massey Ferguson. This joint venture was acquired by Väderstad in 2021. In January of 2021, Amity Technology introduced the Crop Chaser into its lineup. The Crop Chasers are a line of multi-use, high capacity, tracked dump carts. They are limited in production for the first year and will be widely available for model year 2022. Today, the Amity equipment line includes sugar beet harvesters, defoliators, a beet cart, and the Crop Chaser carts. Over the span of these 25 years, Amity has produced more than 1300 sugar beet harvesters for the domestic market, and over 1000 sugar beet harvesters have been exported to other countries. Amity has also received numerous awards, including Fargo-Moorhead’s Business of the Year, North Dakota Exporter of the Year, and INC 500’s list of America’s Fastest Growing Companies. Amity was the first North Dakota company to receive SBA’s Region 6 Exporter of the Year. Amity Technology celebrateS 27 years in 2023.  Employment Opportunities Join our team.

Finding experienced labor during sugar beet harvest is challenging. With AHC, much of the need for an experienced operator is alleviated by sensors on the scalper bars. During operation there are a number of changing dynamics for ground level and sugar beet height – uneven beets, sprayer tracks, and mud building up on the tires. Amity’s AHC system is constantly monitoring the beet height in comparison to the ground level and making adjustments on the height of the defoliator, up and down, as well as side to side. AHC gives you full defoliation with less damage to your sugar beet crop.

With a larger volume scrub, higher profile chain, Dynamic Chain Management, new ISOBUS controller, new door design with lighted access, and the option for tracks or larger tires, the 2720 puts you in control even when conditions are less than ideal. Field-proven Solutions Active Depth Control Harvested without Active Depth Control Harvested with Active Depth Control The Amity row finder is a simple, effective tool to keep your harvester on the row. The row finder also has a backup feature that allows you to back up without lifting the machine or damaging the row finder. Active Depth Control (ADC) on Amity Technology harvesters is a key component in reducing tare and maximizing root yield. As harvester widths have increased, the need for leveling and depth control has emerged. ADC continuously monitors digging depth on both sides and adjusts rear hitch cylinders to minimize tare and maximize yield. New ISOBUS compatibility delivers diagnostic tools ensuring your harvest continues on time. ADC is also ISOBUS compatible. The software is installed on the unity and allows ADC to be controlled from any ISOBUS terminal, allowing for fewer screens in the tractor. Dynamic Chain Management Dynamic Chain Management for proper scrub chain tension Dynamic Chain Management (DCM) adapts the scrub chain to sugar beet volume for easier sugar beet flow through the harvester. This allows for higher scrub capacity, field speed, and longer scrub chain life. Higher Volume Scrub 31% more volume on 2720 scrub The 2720 A new, higher volume scrub on the 2720 has a volume of 59.8 ft³, compared to 45.5 ft³ on the 2700 scrub – a 31% increase in volume! This large increase will allow you to harvest higher tonnage crops faster. Field tests have shown capacity capabilities well beyond 45 tons at 5 mph. Bright lights for better visibility Lights around the harvester make provide great visibility Lights on the boom and back of the scrub tower make things easier to see for both the harvester operator and beet cart or truck driver Operators can easily see into the harvester to make sure things are running smoothly Lights provide better visibility for the inside of the harvester Seeing during the dark times of harvest is a challenge. Bright lights on the 2720 Harvester provide great visibility throughout the machine. LEDs light up every area for safety and convenience during nighttime operation. Lights on the boom and scrub tower make night maneuvers safer. Grabrolls and chains are illuminated for visibility into the machine during operation and maintenance.

The 2300 can be configured to six or eight rows. The lifting strut is the cornerstone of all Amity harvesters. Engineered to lift whole beets, Amity lifting struts are adjustable to minimize unwanted mud or utilize lighter soils to ensure the root enters the harvester. With efficiency in mind, you can adjust the rest of the harvester to clean as required. Scrub tower models are an excellent choice for heavier soils that stick. Amity wheel harvesters are most effective in areas with lighter soils. With the simple design that allows incredible visibility inside the machine, the Amity 2300 wheel harvester lifts sugar beets with fewer wear parts. Choose 4 or 6-row models to maximize production in your operation.

The Amity row finder is a simple, effective tool to keep your harvester on the row. The row finder also has a backup feature that allows you to back up without lifting the machine or damaging the row finder. Active Depth Control (ADC) on Amity harvesters is a major advancement in efficiency and profitability for your operation. As harvester widths increase, the need for leveling the harvester has become a key component in reducing tare and maximizing root yield. During normal operation, harvester weight dynamics are constantly changing. As the tank and boom fill and empty and as field conditions go from wet to dry, ADC continuously monitors the digging depth and make adjustments with the hitch and rear cylinders across the machine. From the monitor in the tractor, the operator sets digging parameters on the circuit board. the sensors, or wands, advise the circuit board of the digging depth. The circuit board then instructs the valve block to make adjustments to the hitch and axle cylinders. *ADC cannot be used with steerable struts ** Restrictions may apply. Consult with your dealer.

Silage/Forage Crops Grain Sugar beets Specialty Crops (beets, sweet corn, edible beans & much more) IMPROVED LOGISTICS / Increased Road Safety One cart load equals one truck load in most cases. Crop Chaser Carts Keep Trucks at the Headlands of the Field Crop Chaser carts add reliability and consistency to harvest operations. By keeping trucks out of the field, crews can run more consistently with fewer weather delays. Furthermore, one cart load equals one truck load in most cases, helping to improve the flow of trucks running to the storage site. Additionally, when trucks are used in the field, they often track mud onto public roads, creating safety and liability issues. Tractors pulling traditional carts cause the same problems when they’re used to transport the product back to the farm. Crop Chaser carts keep trucks at the headlands of the field, helping to prevent them from dragging large amounts of mud onto the road. Light Footprint Tracks Significantly Reduce Compaction Standard Camso 36-by-136-inch tracks The standard 36-by-136-inch tracks on the Crop Chaser dump carts reduce compaction by providing a much lighter footprint than trucks or carts with wheels.

Soil compaction prevents vital nutrients and elements from getting to the plant roots. Losses of Nitrogen to groundwater and the atmosphere is also greater in compacted soil. The Amity Technology CTS-1000 soil compactor measures soil compaction efficiently and easily in all your fields so that you can determine the best plan of action for optimal yields. Combine soil compaction testing with soil sampling for the most complete view of your soil makeup. Accurately measure compaction at depth Compaction mapping and analysis Mobile application from FarmQA captures location and compaction information CTS-1000 Soil Penetrometer As agricultural machinery has increased in both size and number, there has also been an increase in soil compaction. Rather than guessing at the amount and location of soil compaction, which can either lead to yield loss up to 30% or additional fuel costs, Amity Technology brings you a reliable way to determine soil compaction – the CTS-1000 Soil Penetrometer. Ideal Soil The ideal soil is composed of soil particles (sand, silt, and clay), water, air, and organic material. The air can be squeezed from the soil by the weight of machinery, causing compaction by changing the bulk density of the soil Plant roots are sensitive to changes in bulk entity, causing roots to spread laterally. This lateral spread uses less soil volume to feed the plant causing limited yield. Compaction Profile The Amity Technology soil penetrometer is engineered to measure both heavily compacted soils as well as the change in density layers. The compaction testing system from Amity Technology provides an integrated solution, helping to increase yield and reduce costs. Robust The CTS-1000 is engineered to withstand field operations. Soil scientists require a cone penetrometer to be pushed through the soil at a consistent rate. With a hand sampler, it is hard to maintain consistency over dozens of samples. Because the CTS-1000 is electrically driven, it produces a constant stroke every cycle no matter what the soil conditions. This ensures accurate compaction readings every time. *Note: the FarmQA Controller software is required for the use of the CTS-1000. FARMQA is a sister-company to Amity Technology that utilizes a cloud-based platform, FARMQA CONTROLLER, to offer data management from precision agriculture solutions.

By doing so the risk of nitrogen loss to volatility, burning crops, and over applying is reduced. Convert your sprayer into a nitrogen applicator with Nitro-Bars By adapting your sprayer with Nitro-Bars, you have the control of applying nitrogen at the optimum time for increased yields. Highly Accurate The simple, effective design of the Nitro-Bar feeds each of the four ports independently ensuring equal flow and a high standard of application accuracy. Unaffected by Boom Height or Movement Nitro-Bars produce a stream of liquid from each port, with no overlapping pattern. This means that application accuracy is extremely high and remains unaffected by boom height or movement. Applications of nitrogen can therefore be carried throughout the growing season. Reduces the Risk of Leaf Burn Fertilizer contact with the crop is minimized by the configuration of the Nitro-Bar and by the large droplets produced at the leaf surface. This enables the fertilizer to roll off the foliage quickly, virtually eliminating the risk of leaf burn. Easy and Quick to assemble Nitro-Bars fit the standard 20 inch (51 cm) nozzle spacing on sprayers. Using the universal teejet or the Hardi adapters. The Nitro-Bars can be fitted to your sprayer in minutes. Adaptable for all Application rates Color coded quick fit orifice adapters enable the flow rate to be easily adjusted to cover the full range of nitrogen applications. There are five different orifice/adapters available to encompass flow rates from 5 to 80 Gallons (20 to 300 Liters) per acre. For information on what adapter is best for your sprayer see our Nitro-bar Rate Chart Application Method Comparison Kansas State University in 2008 researched the most effective method for applying liquid fertilizer to maximize wheat yield and protein. They found a 9 bushel/acre yield increase using stream bars versus the same product being applied with flat fan nozzles. The return on investment is clear. In this example if wheat was $4.50 per bushel, the grower would have had a $40.50 per acre difference in profit with the same input cost by using Nitro-Bars.

Having the right kind and proper amounts of fertilizer and other inputs is key to a successful crop. 3 steps to soil testing A soil testing program consists of 3 steps: Soil Sampling. One of the most important steps in a soil testing program is to obtain a composite soil sample or samples that accurately represent the soil in the field. This requires good soil sampling equipment like Amity Technology Soil Samplers and a sampling plan with FarmQA. Soil Analysis. For this step you must use proven methods that accurately evaluate the amount of available nutrients in the soil. In addition to good methods of analysis, the laboratory should be very efficient. Fertilizer Recommendations. The end result of a soil analysis is a recommendation telling a grower whether or not to apply fertilizer and, if fertilizer is needed, how much should be applied for the crop to be grown. Soil elements The Amity Technology soil testing package tests soil for: • pH • Nitrate-Nitrogen • Phosphorus • Potassium • Zinc • Iron • Manganese • Copper Efficient Results The Amity Technology Soil Testing package is designed so that four people should be able to prepare and analyze 150 soil samples per day. As experience grows, that could be increased to 300-400 samples per day, or up to 104,000 samples per year, with each sample analyzed for pH, N, P, and K. Profitable production Soil chemical analysis (soil testing) with the Amity Technology custom soil lab is a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable way to determine lime and fertilizer needs for each field before the seed is planted and costly inputs are added. This, combined with good seed, effective weed and disease control, other good management practices, and favorable weather will result in profitable crop production.

Auger-style probes sample at a consistent depth without lifting the mount vehicle. SOIL COMPACTION TESTING Soil compaction is a physical barrier to roots and affects the transmission of vital nutrients and elements through the soil. Testing determines where there are soil compaction problems in the field. AQUASPY Crops depend on water. Between varying soil types and topography, putting water where it’s needed is an ongoing challenge. AquaSpy Soil Moisture Monitoring helps make irrigation decisions easy. NITRO-BARS Nitro-Bars are the most cost-effective stream bars on the market to make in-season liquid nitrogen applications even and accurate. By doing so, the risk of nitrogen loss to volatility, burning crops, and over applying are reduced.
