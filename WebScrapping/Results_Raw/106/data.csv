A true smart battery pairs cells with electronics that provide real-time monitoring and reporting of critical performance data. This data provides important information to your flight computer, allowing it to make decisions in flight, ensuring safe and reliable operation, and early notice of developing problems. It also communicates with the charging system to ensure safe charging and prevent catastrophic failures. Smart batteries can also ensure safe storage and shipping by de-energizing the outputs when not attached to a UAS or charger. Accuracy Provides accurate state of charge information and power warnings to your UAS so you know how much charge you have left. This lets you reduce the margin to fly longer missions or use a smaller battery. Monitoring Monitors cell temperatures, which is particularly important for charging. Charging batteries that are too hot or cold can destroy them quickly. Efficient Storage Automatic self-discharge during storage also dramatically increases the battery’s life. Maintenance Monitoring and reporting faults helps you stay safe and retire your batteries if they’ve been abused or are just wearing out.

In many ways, lithium-ion batteries are the most important component of any modern technology. By transforming standard batteries into smart batteries, Packet Digital changes a required component into an invaluable asset. Contact Us To Learn More What is a “Smart Battery” A true smart battery pairs cells with electronics that provide real-time monitoring and reporting of critical performance data. This data provides important information to your flight computer, allowing it to make decisions in flight, ensuring safe and reliable operation, and early notice of developing problems. It also communicates with the charging system to ensure safe charging and prevent catastrophic failures. Smart batteries can also ensure safe storage and shipping by de-energizing the outputs when not attached to a UAS or charger. From a hardware aspect, it’s the BMS (battery management system), a circuit board that is paired with the cells, that makes a smart battery different than a traditional, or “dumb” battery. Maximize Flight Time And Profits By using energy more efficiently, an unmanned aircraft is able to fly longer on a charge, making every trip more productive. Collect Important Data Think of a smart battery as a black box for the UAS, recording and reporting how the battery is treated and how it performs under ever-changing conditions. Improve Operational Safety Regulatory focus will become even more intense as UAS take to the skies above population centers, making battery status more important Reduce Aircraft Weight By maximizing your available battery footprint, you eliminate the need for backup batteries or larger batteries. Increase Battery Life By regulating charging, smart batteries from Packet Digital are able to last longer and age more gracefully. Packet Digital’s Custom Battery Development Experience Anduril, the maker of the Ghost VTOL Group 2 sUAS, contracted Packet Digital to manufacture batteries. Packet Digital manufacturing capabilities were essential to tackle this highly challenging build. Additionally, Packet was able to quickly resolve critical supply chain issues through collaboration and experience with top component providers. Lockheed Martin contracted with Packet Digital to design and manufacture batteries for their Indago 4 UAS platform. “We have been cycling Packet Digital’s battery for 6 months. It is now at 1000 cycles that’s 10X better than anything we have ever seen, and it only shows 11% degradation”. – Lockheed Martin, Chief Engineer Smart Batteries From Packet Digital High cycle life LiPo batteries with battery management system. Accurate, state-of-charge monitoring and reportingStores critical lifetime information such as:Total usageFaultsOverall pack health and estimationUSB connectivity for computer/phone/tablet interfaceTechnology is adaptable to other configurationsRecord min/max voltage and current Questions? We have answers. What questions should you ask your battery designer or supplier? What does C-rate mean? What discharge rate do I need for my pack? C-rate refers to how much current it takes to discharge the pack in 1 hour. It’s essentially the inverse of the pack capacity. A 10,000 milli-amp-hour (mAh) battery can supply 10 Amps of current for 1 hour, theoretically. If that pack is rated for 1C discharge rate, then it can do that. If it’s rated for 2C, that means that it can actually source 20A for a half hour. If it’s rated for 4C, it can source 40A. If it’s rated for 100C it can source 1000A. This is, of course, a simplification. There are different rates for very short duration pulses, somewhat short duration pulses (~10s), and continuous (>10s). The shorter duration ratings are often the ones marketed, but the continuous rating is what is usually important. Note that continuous is only defined as 10s duration. When you get into that time scale you have to deal with chemical diffusions, which are a slow process. There are two ways to look at your C rating, and it’s useful to look at both. One is your peak current. If you need 100 Amps of current for more than 10s (continuous), then you need a pack that’s rated for 100 / capacity C-rate. But it can be difficult to estimate the continuous current, so if you know your minimum flight time, you can use that to directly calculate the C rate. If you fly for 15 minutes minimum with your biggest payload and highest wind conditions, then you need a 4C pack. Realistically, you’ll want to add some margin since you might have some short bursts of higher current. It’s easy to get into a situation where your power system is theoretically capable of draining your pack in 2 minutes, but in reality you have 15 minutes of flight time so you do need to look at things both ways and use your judgment to select an appropriate pack if you don’t have the capability to simulate or measure actual requirements. What does 6S2P mean? S is series and P is parallel. Series raises voltage and parallel raises Amp-hour capacity. Either configuration raises total energy capacity by the same amount. More parallel cells increases the Amp-hours and current rating of the pack, and more series cells increases the voltage of the pack. What power density do I need? There is a tradeoff between power and energy density that can be compensated for with added cost. High power cells and high energy cells can be made relatively cheaply, but high power cells that are also high energy require complex, expensive design. It’s important to look at the continuous C-rating of the cells and consider that higher voltages might make the whole system more efficient. When looking at the C-rating, make sure to consider that there is a pulse rating and a continuous rating. Generally anything over 10 seconds is considered continuous so if your peak current happens at takeoff or landing, you need to spec your pack based on that. Does the battery connect to an autopilot for real time telemetry data? A smart battery that can’t communicate with the vehicle has little value. What is the real-world cycle life of the pack (not just the cells)? Cycle life of a pack is worse than that of the cells that it comprises. The weakest link determines the fate of the pack. So looking at average cycle life of cells isn’t directly useful in estimating your pack cycle life. Pack cycle life may be 50% or even worse due to variation in cells and thermal and electrical imbalance in the pack design. If you have a target pack cycle life in mind, make sure to investigate what that means when compared to the cell cycle life because they are not the same thing. What voltage should I use? You can increase voltage by adding cells in series. The tradeoff is that for the same weight of battery, you’ll have lower amp-hour capacity, but higher voltage and the same amount of energy. The benefit is that at higher voltages you can draw less current for the same amount of power. This is good because efficiency is inversely proportional to current, so we increase system efficiency by raising voltage. You can use smaller, lighter wires and more compact motors with higher voltage. Higher voltage does come with costs, high voltage electronics tend to cost more, so ultimately voltage tends to scale with vehicle size. However, it’s usually useful to design toward higher voltages if your goals are higher efficiency and longer endurance. What energy density do I need? Energy density is simply the energy capacity (voltage * amp-hour capacity) of the pack divided by the weight. The energy of the pack is proportional to your endurance and the weight of the pack is also, inversely, proportional. The battery is usually one of the largest weights and so is targeted for optimization. Energy density at the pack level includes the weight of the enclosure, wires, connectors, BMS, and other packaging materials, and results in a somewhat lower energy density than you would see at the cell level. Cost tends to increase exponentially with increased energy density so, while high energy density packs are extremely valuable for long endurance aircraft, it’s one part of an overall weight reduction strategy that should be discussed and considered carefully. Is cooling necessary? Generally speaking, yes. Unless you’re discharging so quickly that cooling won’t come into play, maybe 2-5 minutes flight time, cooling can make an important difference in system performance. High energy cells tend to produce more heat and efficiently removing that heat means that you can keep those cells cool and last for many flights. High power, high energy, and sealed systems with no cooling are the worst situation for batteries and typically result in the shortest cycle lives. Country of origin? Country of manufacture? Smart batteries process data and communicate with the aircraft and therefore are or will be restricted by country of origin for government use.

CAN bitrate: 1Mbps UAVCAN Vendor Specific Type definitions Charging: Fully charge battery before and after use Use a charger that is designed for LiPo batteries only. Never leave the battery unattended while charging. Do not attempt to charge the battery in temperature environments above 40°C or below 10°C, or if the pack temperature is >45°C General Use: Secure battery in vehicle before use The battery will generate heat during use. Never allow pack temperature to rise above 70°C during use as cell damage or fire may occur. Warm ambient temperatures, high initial pack temperatures, and heavy loads will generally lead to higher pack temperatures during use. Regarding cold ambient or initial pack temperatures, prewarm before use. The use of batteries below 0°C will result in a permanent reduction in battery capacity. Disposal: Dispose of battery only at an appropriate hazardous waste disposal site Preventing Cell Undervoltage: Avoid deep discharge. Even one over-discharge will lead to permanent damage. Monitor state of charge and cell voltages while in flight. Pay close attention to cell voltages when state of charge is below 10% State of charge estimation is on a pack basis and not on a cell basis and therefore there is a risk to undervolting cells in the near-empty region Never allow a cell to drop below 3.0V or permanent damage to the cell will occur Storage: Preferred storage at 50% of nominal battery capacity. Store in a temperature-controlled space (preferably between 20°C and 30°C), away from moisture, sources of heat, open flames Sets the output voltage when the output power is less than the maximum powerpoint. This value should be larger than the battery voltage. This does not take effect until the next time the output is turned on.

Vin or Vout can operate down to 8V as long as the other (Vout or Vin respectively) is above 11V.2. Factor in the solar array voltage over the entire operating temperature range Safe Operating Area While these MPPTs are highly efficient, they also have very low surface area and thermal mass due to optimizations for aircraft applications. They have thermal monitoring capabilities and will decrease output power if temperature rises too high in order to protect themselves. The input and output voltage and current limitations always apply. Furthermore, efficiency is negatively impacted by high conversion ratios (e.g. low PV voltage and high battery voltage or vice versa) and lower conversion efficiency results in higher heat generation. In situations with high conversion ratios or if the MPPT is in a hot ambient environment or a tightly enclosed space, cooling airflow may be required. Temperature data is available in the telemetry stream for monitoring purposes.

FCC Part 15B CE UL UN/DOT 38.3 None CAPTCHA Questions? We have answers. What questions should you ask your battery designer or supplier? What does C-rate mean? What discharge rate do I need for my pack? C-rate refers to how much current it takes to discharge the pack in 1 hour. It’s essentially the inverse of the pack capacity. A 10,000 milli-amp-hour (mAh) battery can supply 10 Amps of current for 1 hour, theoretically. If that pack is rated for 1C discharge rate, then it can do that. If it’s rated for 2C, that means that it can actually source 20A for a half hour. If it’s rated for 4C, it can source 40A. If it’s rated for 100C it can source 1000A. This is, of course, a simplification. There are different rates for very short duration pulses, somewhat short duration pulses (~10s), and continuous (>10s). The shorter duration ratings are often the ones marketed, but the continuous rating is what is usually important. Note that continuous is only defined as 10s duration. When you get into that time scale you have to deal with chemical diffusions, which are a slow process. There are two ways to look at your C rating, and it’s useful to look at both. One is your peak current. If you need 100 Amps of current for more than 10s (continuous), then you need a pack that’s rated for 100 / capacity C-rate. But it can be difficult to estimate the continuous current, so if you know your minimum flight time, you can use that to directly calculate the C rate. If you fly for 15 minutes minimum with your biggest payload and highest wind conditions, then you need a 4C pack. Realistically, you’ll want to add some margin since you might have some short bursts of higher current. It’s easy to get into a situation where your power system is theoretically capable of draining your pack in 2 minutes, but in reality you have 15 minutes of flight time so you do need to look at things both ways and use your judgment to select an appropriate pack if you don’t have the capability to simulate or measure actual requirements. What does 6S2P mean? S is series and P is parallel. Series raises voltage and parallel raises Amp-hour capacity. Either configuration raises total energy capacity by the same amount. More parallel cells increases the Amp-hours and current rating of the pack, and more series cells increases the voltage of the pack. What power density do I need? There is a tradeoff between power and energy density that can be compensated for with added cost. High power cells and high energy cells can be made relatively cheaply, but high power cells that are also high energy require complex, expensive design. It’s important to look at the continuous C-rating of the cells and consider that higher voltages might make the whole system more efficient. When looking at the C-rating, make sure to consider that there is a pulse rating and a continuous rating. Generally anything over 10 seconds is considered continuous so if your peak current happens at takeoff or landing, you need to spec your pack based on that. Does the battery connect to an autopilot for real time telemetry data? A smart battery that can’t communicate with the vehicle has little value. What is the real-world cycle life of the pack (not just the cells)? Cycle life of a pack is worse than that of the cells that it comprises. The weakest link determines the fate of the pack. So looking at average cycle life of cells isn’t directly useful in estimating your pack cycle life. Pack cycle life may be 50% or even worse due to variation in cells and thermal and electrical imbalance in the pack design. If you have a target pack cycle life in mind, make sure to investigate what that means when compared to the cell cycle life because they are not the same thing. What voltage should I use? You can increase voltage by adding cells in series. The tradeoff is that for the same weight of battery, you’ll have lower amp-hour capacity, but higher voltage and the same amount of energy. The benefit is that at higher voltages you can draw less current for the same amount of power. This is good because efficiency is inversely proportional to current, so we increase system efficiency by raising voltage. You can use smaller, lighter wires and more compact motors with higher voltage. Higher voltage does come with costs, high voltage electronics tend to cost more, so ultimately voltage tends to scale with vehicle size. However, it’s usually useful to design toward higher voltages if your goals are higher efficiency and longer endurance. What energy density do I need? Energy density is simply the energy capacity (voltage * amp-hour capacity) of the pack divided by the weight. The energy of the pack is proportional to your endurance and the weight of the pack is also, inversely, proportional. The battery is usually one of the largest weights and so is targeted for optimization. Energy density at the pack level includes the weight of the enclosure, wires, connectors, BMS, and other packaging materials, and results in a somewhat lower energy density than you would see at the cell level. Cost tends to increase exponentially with increased energy density so, while high energy density packs are extremely valuable for long endurance aircraft, it’s one part of an overall weight reduction strategy that should be discussed and considered carefully. Is cooling necessary? Generally speaking, yes. Unless you’re discharging so quickly that cooling won’t come into play, maybe 2-5 minutes flight time, cooling can make an important difference in system performance. High energy cells tend to produce more heat and efficiently removing that heat means that you can keep those cells cool and last for many flights. High power, high energy, and sealed systems with no cooling are the worst situation for batteries and typically result in the shortest cycle lives. Country of origin? Country of manufacture? Smart batteries process data and communicate with the aircraft and therefore are or will be restricted by country of origin for government use.

One of the key milestones in achieving this goal was the installation of a surface mount technology (SMT) line — the first of its kind for Packet Digital. The SMT line allows Packet Digital to manufacture its own printed circuit boards (PCBs) in-house. Up to 130 unique components can be populated on each side of the board, primarily using a lead-free process. With board assembly done in-house, Packet Digital will now be able to optimize designs for an efficient manufacturing process. Control of production timelines as well as flexibility in PCB sourcing allows Packet Digital to offer more reliable timelines and better pricing to its customers. Assembled PCBs will be incorporated into existing Packet Digital products such as battery packs and chargers, in addition to direct sales to strategic partners. To accomplish these goals, a variety of machines were installed to complete the SMT line, including: a solder paste printer, solder paste inspection, pick and place machine, optical inspection, and multi-zone reflow oven. Aside from the machinery itself, humidity controls and electrostatic discharge (ESD) flooring were installed to ensure quality production. What is an SMT line? SMT is the process of mounting electronic components directly onto the surface of a PCB. The process is automated, allowing boards to be produced quicker and more accurately than manual population of components. The process begins with the solder paste printer and inspection machines that place solder on the board and verify that it was applied correctly. When the solder application process is complete, electronic components are then placed on circuit boards by the high-speed pick and place machine. It takes individual components from reels or trays and places them precisely where they belong on the PCB on top of the solder paste. The optical inspection machine then allows our assemblers to detect any issues and ensure the quality of each individual component on the board. Once the board has been cleared for production, it moves to the multi-zone reflow oven where the solder is melted to make electro-mechanical connections with the components. After this the board is now complete and moves on to QA testing, programming, coating and final assembly into products. ← Packet Digital Creating State of the Art Battery Manufacturing Facility in Fargo, ND ""*"" indicates required fields Subscribe to email:* CAPTCHACommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
