Cardinal has over 400 million insulating glass units under warranty. To reduce IG unit seal failure, we know how to keep it low. Cardinal’s warranty for our stainless-steel spacer IG units is the longest in the industry. For window manufacturers, our warranty is a safety net of reliability for their IG investment. Cardinal IG Seal Durability Failure Rates for Installed IG Units This graph contrasts the failure rates of legacy products and current Cardinal IG technologies. Cardinal drastically cut IG unit failures after the 1978 introduction of dual-seal silicone. Thanks to continuous research and development, Cardinal is setting a new standard for IG unit durability with Endur. Cardinal IG Seal Durability Failure Rates for Installed IG Units This graph contrasts the failure rates of legacy products and current Cardinal IG technologies. Cardinal drastically cut IG unit failures after the 1978 introduction of dual-seal silicone. Thanks to continuous research and development, Cardinal sets the standard for IG unit durability with Endur. Cardinal subjects IG units to the demanding P-1 test to determine long-term seal durability. Test criteria simulate worst-case, real-world scenarios: 140º F, constant UV exposure and 100% humidity. Results showed that competitive seal systems failed within 8 to 22 weeks of testing. Endur IG, utilizing silicone dual-seal construction, routinely passes 80 weeks exposure with dew points below 0°F (-18°C). Endur Makes Your Window Job Stay Done Early IG unit failures can wipe out profit margins. Warranty repairs cost dearly in labor, materials, and diminished customer satisfaction. But with Endur, you reduce your risk of costly service visits. Our incredibly low failure rate means that warranty repairs for seal failure are a rare event. But in the case of failure, we’ll back you up unlike any other glass company. Your IG investment is guaranteed for 20 years, with up to a 150% credit warranty. There is simply no other company willing to match that level of risk. A New Generation Spacer Design Endur IG spacer is an upgrade to our previous-generation XL Edge. Endur’s patented warm-edge spacer design delivers enhanced condensation resistance and a 1-2 degree improved sightline temperature. The corrugated shape adds strength. Unlike notched or open joints, the bent corners form a continuous impermeable metal barrier around the entire perimeter, keeping moisture out and argon in. Overlapping seams along ears allow breathing. The new spacer is also more aesthetically pleasing. Finally, our Endur IG unit can improve overall window U-Factor up to 0.005 – a big deal when chasing the last 0.01 decimal for compliance to energy code. More Than Just a Spacer The components of Endur IG’s design render the highest performance and durability improvements. Spacer: Stainless steel spacer features a roll formed design to provide maximum area for primary and secondary sealant coverage. It provides increased resistance to condensation and less stress on the IG seal system. No polymer content minimizes the risk of chemical fogging. Primary Seal: Polyisobutylene (PIB) minimizes moisture permeation, is UV resistant and provides an outstanding argon barrier. Desiccants: Beaded molecular sieve provides initial frost points below -65°F. Desiccant assures optimum moisture adsorption while minimizing the effects of temperature-related pressure changes. Secondary Seal: Specially formulated silicone provides long-term adhesion, withstands UV exposure, and provides excellent durability when exposed to moisture. Silicone also provides structural integrity. Made for Thermal and Solar Efficiency Endur insulating glass is fabricated with Cardinal’s industry leading LoĒ coatings. We offer a variety of standard LoĒ and room-side LoĒ coatings to augment thermal efficiency, lower solar heat gain, and meet stringent performance standards. Northern US and Canada For the greatest thermal comfort under winter conditions, Cardinal produces triple-pane Endur IG units starting as thin as 7/8” or almost any glass and spacer thickness combination. Options to Satisfy Any Design Requirement Our eleven advanced, automated IG facilities are equipped to provide the right IG products for your window and door designs. LoĒ coatings for energy efficiency, aesthetics, and comfort Tempered and laminated glazings for safety and security​ Custom shapes and sizes​ Decorative internal bars​ Natural steel and painted black spacer options​ Preserve film for glass protection through installation​ Endur Prevails Where Others Fail Our entire production stack is designed to provide high quality, low defect insulating glass promptly for even the highest order demand.

Pre-applied on Cardinal insulating glass (IG) units, Preserve film protects everybody’s interests. It also protects your relationship with the homeowner, as they get undamaged, clean windows every time. On the job site, stuff happens. Spattered paint. Excess stucco. Slopped mud. Scratched glass. By the time construction is over, the windows are a mess.Post-construction cleanup is an annoyance, as you spend time and money cleaning instead of moving to the next job.But if your windows are covered with Preserve, cleanup is a snap. When the job is over, builders simply peel off Preserve and throw it away– along with all the grime, even the labels. From the Factory through Customer Handover We at Cardinal and our window manufacturers take care to ensure that glass leaves factories in flawless condition.Preserve is the clear solution to window protection. This patented film defends your glass. Factory-applied to both the outer and inner surfaces in overlapping layers, it ensures that the entire glass surface is protected all the way through the phases of construction, up to client approval. The fast and furious are not always the careful and cautious. Construction crews. Hard-working, sure. Careful, not always. By the time everyone is finished, the windows are filthy. In addition, labels create “ghosting,” leaving a distracting visual blemish. Cleaning up this mess at the end of the job is a hassle, taking up valuable time and labor. Even worse, damaged glass must be reordered and replaced. Preserve solves this job-site dilemma. Because the film is applied at the factory, construction crews do not waste time applying and removing protective coverings such as tapes, films or sprays. Other makeshift fixes like newspaper or cardboard are also avoided, since they block out light.Preserve is clear, so natural light still shines into the interior of the structure. Preserve saves you time, money, and a lot of hassle. Without Preserve, glass generally requires at least two heavy-duty cleanings before a job is finished. A recent market research study found that Preserve could save hundreds of dollars per house in cleanup costs. Not exactly pocket change.With Preserve, you say goodbye to these time-wasting cleanups. At the end of construction, Preserve peels off, taking the accumulated dirt and labels with it. Clean windows can mean a shorter punch list. Finally, because Preserve contains no harmful chemicals or by-products, it can be disposed of with the rest of normal construction site debris.So Preserve your windows. It protects the glass, reduces cleanup times, and keeps your customers happy. And it helps deliver a beautiful home, with glistening and undamaged windows. Preserve Specifications Length min 10.0”, max unlimited Width min 4.5”, max unlimited Dimensional tolerances +/-0.25” Facts about Preserve Preserve incorporates a water-based adhesive and is rated as a low-density polyethylene. Preserve should be removed within six months of installation. Preserve should not be pressurewashed.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors XL Edge Insulating Glass CARDINAL IG COMPANY Durable Insulating Glass The IG that Set the Benchmark for Low Failure Rate XL Edge® is Cardinal’s original warm-edge insulating glass unit featuring a 20-year warranty. Launched in 1993, XL Edge is the pioneer of highly durable and energy-efficient spacer systems. XL Edge is available today in double and triple-pane configurations. Industry’s Lowest Failure Rate XL Edge IG comes with the lowest failure rate in the industry: an incredible 0.2% over twenty years. We achieved this success on a foundation of 50+ years of experience in manufacturing IG units, with over 40 years utilizing a dual-seal silicone system. We’ll back your business: XL Edge IG comes with a 20-year, 150% credit warranty. It’s like an insurance policy for your window business. No other IG manufacturer will offer such a guarantee. XL Edge IG Construction Pane of Glass Primary seal (PIB) Thin gaugestainless steel Desiccant fill Secondary seal (silicone) XL Edge is a leading-edge stainless steel spacer with airtight bent corners and a dual-seal construction of compressed polyisobutylene (PIB) and silicone. Desiccants eliminate any potential for moisture. Argon fill improves window U-factor. Since XL Edge is a warm-edge IG, the possibility of indoor condensation is greatly reduced. Say farewell to IG failure. Cardinal’s superior IG construction translates into a 0.2% seal failure rate over twenty years, plainly the lowest in the industry. To compare, a vintage organically sealed IG unit—still regularly used in new windows today—has an 8.4% failure rate after 20 years. Even modern competitive spacer systems simply cannot match the long-term durability characteristics of XL Edge. Enhanced Thermal Performance XL Edge improves window U-factor by as much as 0.03 compared to an identical configuration using an aluminum spacer. With our advanced LoĒ coatings, XL Edge renders outstanding thermal performance. These benefits make all the difference in compliance with local energy codes. If your marketing plan includes the ENERGY STAR® Windows program, XL Edge can be effective in qualifying more of your window and door configurations. The warm-edge characteristics of XL Edge IG reduce the frequency and amount of condensation during extreme temperature conditions. For a typical wood/vinyl window design, it would have to be 12°F colder outside before condensation forms on a unit with XL Edge in comparison with aluminum. Low failures mean long-term success. Compare your IG seal failure rate with the 0.2% failure rate of XL Edge IG. Over time, conventional IG units are increasingly prone to failure. The longer the warranty period, the more your profits may be eroded. But not with XL Edge–your windows last longer, your customers stay happy, and your profits are preserved. This is illustrated in the following chart. Assuming a $500 service call to replace a failed IG unit under warranty, and with an 8% seal failure rate, the window manufacturer would need to add $40 to the cost of the window to cover warranty costs. With a 0.2% seal failure rate, the window manufacturer would only need to add $1.25 to the window to cover warranty claims. Warranty costs vs. field failure rate XL Edge Facts Cardinal fabricates over 20 million IG units annually, with eleven IG facilities in the U.S. to accommodate any level of demand, always on time. LoĒ coatings, tempering, lamination, internal grilles and bars, and custom shapes and sizes are all available as options. Cardinal IG Company offers electronic order processing and logistics services for the demands of today’s marketplace. Maintain your competitive edge. Cardinal IG’s advanced manufacturing capabilities, leading spacer technology and reputation for superior product quality make partnering with us a safe and easy proposition.Contact your nearest Cardinal IG facility to learn more about XL Edge and our 20-year commitment to the integrity of your window and door business.

It offers excellent visible light transmittance and low reflectance. Yet it delivers a center-of-glass U-factor of just 0.20 when coupled with our LoĒ³ or LoĒ² glass and argon fill in a 2-pane unit.Even without argon and with or without capillary tubes, the unit still delivers a U-factor of just 0.23 – perfect for high altitudes. When regular LoĒ coated windows include room-side LoĒ-i89, more windows can meet the strict ENERGY STAR 7.0 requirements.What’s more, LoĒ-i89 is easy to clean. It’s as scratch resistant as regular annealed glass. And there’s no haze to mar the view. That’s LoĒ-i89, our enhanced winter performance glass. Double-pane windows becometriple-pane performers. With LoĒ-i89, you have more options. There’s less need to go to triple-pane windows to meet the various energy-saving guidelines. No need to invest in redesigning your windows and altering your manufacturing processes either. A double-pane IG unit with LoĒ-i89 can meet the guidelines for most climate zones. LoĒ-i89 is sputtered onto the indoor lite, the #4 surface, thus reflecting escaping heat back into the room and lowering U-factors. Coupled with our LoĒ² or LoĒ³ glass and argon fill, this double-pane unit delivers performance much better than clear triple-pane – a center of glass U-factor of just 0.20 compared to 0.37 with clear triple-pane.To surpass the U-factor performance of our LoĒ-i89 double-pane unit, you would need to go to a triple-pane unit with a low-E coating in each gap. But for maximum thermal control, a triple-pane IG with LoĒ-i89 on the #6 surface provides unmatched performance. Heat is reflected, not lost. OrdinaryClear Glass The advantages are more than clear. In addition to providing maximum energy efficiency in a double-pane unit, LoĒ-i89 offers several other customer-pleasing benefits.Its surface is smooth and scratch resistant, making it easier to remove label residue and clean. And perhaps most importantly, there’s no haze to mar the view.Rather than absorbing internal heat, LoĒ-i89 reflects it back into the room, making your living space feel warmer and more comfortable. Naturally, Endur IG units with LoĒ-i89 live up to the Cardinal reputation for long-range durability, delivering the industry’s lowest failure rate – only 0.20% over 20 years.Give homeowners another reason to love LoĒ-i89 units – include Neat+® naturally clean glass on the outside. Your windows stay cleaner longer and clean easier. Finally, protect your windows in transit as well as on the job site with Preserve® protective film. LoĒ-i89 and Interior Condensation High relative humidity (RH) in a home can cause condensation on interior glass surfaces, with outdoor ambient temperature and indoor room temperature also playing a role. LoĒ-i89, which reflects interior heat, can make the room-side glass surface cooler and increase condensation risk during winter. To prevent condensation, the U.S. ENERGY STAR program advises maintaining 30-40% relative humidity in colder climates. LoĒ-i89 is always paired with a regular LoĒ coating, and delivers glass temperatures high enough to resist indoor condensation.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors LoĒ-Di89 Glass CARDINAL CG COMPANY Enhanced Compliance for all of Canada A New Coating for Cold Canadian Weather Manufacturers need flexible choices when designing windows to beat the Canada ENERGY STAR® 2020 code. So we now offer a new option for the Canadian residential market. It is called LoĒ-Di89™, a new application of our LoĒ-i89™ coating. LoĒ-Di89 glass gives manufacturers that extra nudge over LoĒ-180ESC™ to meet Canada code compliance. Canadian ENERGY STAR 5.0 Requirements For Canada, ENERGY STAR version 5.0 went into effect on January 1, 2020. These new requirements mean that windows and doors now must meet a minimum Energy Rating (ER) of 34. To meet that condition, dual pane units need to balance a high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with a low U-Factor. LoĒ-Di89: Made for Canada LoĒ-Di89 is engineered to help more windows and doors meet the new Energy Rating of 34 throughout Canada. LoĒ-Di89 is a coating applied to the 3rd and 4th surface of a dual pane unit which allows more energy from the sun to enter the home while the low U-Factor keeps the heat in. LoĒ-Di89 is available in a variety of custom shapes and sizes and can be heat-strengthened or tempered. In some configurations heat-strengthening may be recommended to mitigate against the effects of thermal stress. Performance Matters The design of a window or door requires a careful selection of materials like the sash, frame, decorative bars, as well as the glass. All of these pieces can affect the total performance values of a completed product. Therefore, some glazing options can be more advantageous for particular designs over others. With LoĒ-Di89 glass, the advantage lies in the combination of a very high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and a very low U-Factor. The high SHGC allow more passive heat from the sun to enter the home, and the low U-Factor helps retain heat within the home’s interior.

With unparalleled solar performance and optimum glare protection, LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 keep the sun in its place. The result? Maximum comfort and great views, even on the warmest of days. LoĒ²-240 is an excellent overall performer for climates where the sun is constantly on the offensive. As a specially formulated two-layer coating, many opt for LoĒ²-240 for its great solar performance and gentle gray hue. Our newest triple-layer LoĒ³-340 simply has no equal for reducing solar heat gain.Its SHGC of 0.18 slashes the sun’s thermal energy. And wherever glare is a problem, LoĒ³-340 keeps it in check.LoĒ³-340 delivers the lowest UV blocking of any LoĒ glass we offer. This greatly reduces fading on furniture, carpet, drapes, and everything inside the home. Control the Glare. Too much sunlight makes it difficult to see. This can cause problems like eye strain, headaches, and overall discomfort. Furthermore, solar glare can make it hard to use computer screens, televisions, and electronic devices. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 glass have special anti-glare properties that allow sufficient visible light through, without being excessive. No need to use drapes or blinds, which otherwise diminish the visual benefit of windows in the first place. Glare Control Comparisons Glare Control Glass Rejects most solar heat, controls glare. Rooms stay cool, comfy and attractive. Grey Tinted Glass Cuts sunlight by 50%, but poor solar heat control. Glass temperatures can exceed 100°F. Clear Glass Transmits 80% of solar energy. No glare control, no protection. Blinds required. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 Cut Out Unwanted Parts of the Spectrum Ultraviolet (UV) UV is invisible and makes upabout 3% of the total solar energy. This region of wavelengths is typically associated with fading of fabrics, paints, furniture, and other household items. Visible Light This portion of the solar spectrum makes up about 45% of total solar energy. Near Infrared (NIR) NIR is approximately 52% of the solar energy and invisible to the eye. What makes these glass coatings different is their ability to handle each portion of the solar spectrum differently.The plot shows the “spectrally selective” nature of the LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 coatings. They cut down heat-inducing infrared light and nearly eliminate ultraviolet transmission, while maintaining a proportionately high level of the visible range. LoĒ²-240 LoĒ3-340 84% 98% Blocks over 84% 98% of the harmful UV radiation. 60% 60% Rejects 60% 60% of the visible light, which gives the coating excellent glare control. ~92% ~99% Rejects nearly all the heat producing infrared rays. UV LIGHT VISIBLE LIGHT NIR LIGHT Grey Tinted Glass Clear Glass Wavelength (Nanometers) Light Spectrum Enjoy all season comfort. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 control more than the sun. During cold weather, their advanced coating design also provides an extremely low U-Factor to deliver comfort and energy savings. Year-round thermal comfort is a result of warm glass temperatures in the winter, cool glass temperatures in the summer, and the blockage of oppressive solar heat gains. Note in the chart below that the solar blockage for single pane tinted glass is marginal, and the extreme temperature fluctuations can lead to serious year-round comfort problems.

A double-pane window with a conventional tinted glass improves some solar blockage but leaves the building occupants exposed to hot glass temperatures in the summer. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 are placed on the #2 surface (air-space side of outdoor pane) and provides the best comfort through all the seasons. Get ready for maximum solar comfort If you envision your home’s design benefiting from a tinted glass for glare control, both LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 offer a great combination of aesthetic appeal along with energy performance and indoor comfort.

Double glazing improves the winter comfort, especially when a low emittance LoĒ² coating is used. A double-pane window with a conventional tinted glass and low-e on the #3 surface (air space side of indoor pane) improves the solar blockage but leaves the building occupants exposed to hot glass temperatures in the summer. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 are placed on the #2 surface (air-space side of outdoor pane) and provide the best comfort through all the seasons. Less heat gain when it’s hot, less heat loss when it’s cold, more comfort year-round, and the best glare control under the sun. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 can be purchased in heat- strengthened, tempered, and laminated glass configurations, with a variety of shapes and sizes.

A New Generation, Available Now. Neat+ Glass is the latest generation of lower maintenance glass. With Neat+, glass is naturally cleaner. Since 2006, more than 57 million windows with Neat glass have been sold, serving as the leading product for low maintenance glass. It Pays for Itself in Reclaimed Weekends. Mother Nature + Science =Cleaner Windows. Window cleaning is a chore. Exterior window surfaces require constant maintenance, but not so with Neat+ glass. Neat+ means glass stays cleaner longer. And when you must clean your glass, it’ll be easier and fast. Neat+ uses a combination of static dissipation to reduce the amount of dust on the window’s surface, along with help from the sun to break down greenhouse gases and other pollutants to keep the window naturally cleaner. Conductive Surface: 40% Less Dust. Neat+ is more conductive than uncoated glass, which results in a dissipation of static charge on the surface. Test results from an outside lab show 40% less dust on the Neat+ surface compared to uncoated glass. This means cleaner windows. The homeowner also uses less water and fewer cleaning chemicals, which save time, money, and environmental resources. Ordinary Glass Regular glass surface can be statically charged and attract dust particles Neat + Anti-Static Neat+ is a conductive surface, so dustparticles are not attracted, reducing buildup TiO2 Coating: Advanced Photoactivity. The titanium dioxide layer of Neat+ glass reacts chemically with the sun’s UV rays and causes greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are on the glass to decompose. Neat+ is 25% more photoactive than the original Neat glass. How Neat+ Works The anti-static Neat+ surface reduces dust buildup by 40% Even if you don’t clean your windows regularly, Neat+ means your glass stays cleaner longer When exposed to sunlight, the Neat+ surface actively produces hydroxyl groups which chemically break down greenhouse gases and other pollutants Neat+ Glass Is the Greener Choice. In addition to decomposing greenhouse pollutants, Cardinal’s Neat+ fabrication methods also contribute to environmental efficiency.Cardinal’s patented double-sputtering process permanently deposits silicon and titanium dioxide on the bottom of the glass during the same pass through the coater as our energy-efficient LoĒ coatings, reducing the amount of energy needed to coat both glass surfaces. The combination of Neat+ and LoĒ keeps windows cleaner longer while providing energy savings to the homeowner. LoĒ Comfort and Efficiency.

LoĒ³-366® Raises the Bar for Glass Performance For decades, Cardinal has set the standard for energy efficient glass. Our LoĒ³-366 coated glass lifts the performance threshold to a new level. A Perfect Balance, With the triple-layer coating of LoĒ³-366, you can truly have it all. Year-Round Comfort Unmatched Visibility and Aesthetics Substantial Energy Savings LoĒ³-366 is a clear coating that blocks even more solar gain, reflects heat, and lets the light stream in. It even outperforms the tinted glass often used in warm climates. Beats the Heat. Keeps the View When the temperature soars, ordinary window glass just can’t handle the heat. And tinted glass darkens the view Our patented LoĒ³-366 glass has been formulated to reject the sun’s heat without spoiling visibility. It lets more light in and keeps more heat out. It protects building interiors LoĒ³-366 provides exceptional fading protection. It blocks 95% of the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays, protecting your furniture, carpets, curtains and wall coverings for years to come. It’s the perfect cold remedy, too During cold weather, the insulating effect of your windows has a direct impact on how your rooms feel. The largest exposed surface of a window is the glass, and the temperature of the room-side of the glass directly affects the air temperature in the room. The better insulated the window glass, the warmer your room will be.To maintain the best comfort during the winter, select a glass product that produces surface temperatures that stay above this point during the coldest outdoor conditions. Inside Glass and Outside Temperatures The table below compares the room-side center of glass temperatures of different glass types against two winter conditions.

The dramatic comfort improvement from windows with warm glass surfaces also means the relative humidity of the indoor air can be controlled and maintained properly. Proper humidity levels improve comfort and promote a healthier living environment. What makes LoĒ³-366 glass different is its ability to handle each portion of the solar spectrum differently. The chart below shows the “spectrally selective” nature of the LoĒ³-366 coating. LoĒ³-366 cuts down heat-inducing infrared light and nearly eliminates ultraviolet transmission, while maintaining a high level of the visible light transmittance.

With unparalleled solar performance and optimum glare protection, LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 keep the sun in its place. The result? Maximum comfort and great views, even on the warmest of days. LoĒ²-240 is an excellent overall performer for climates where the sun is constantly on the offensive. As a specially formulated two-layer coating, many opt for LoĒ²-240 for its great solar performance and gentle gray hue. Our newest triple-layer LoĒ³-340 simply has no equal for reducing solar heat gain.Its SHGC of 0.18 slashes the sun’s thermal energy. And wherever glare is a problem, LoĒ³-340 keeps it in check.LoĒ³-340 delivers the lowest UV blocking of any LoĒ glass we offer. This greatly reduces fading on furniture, carpet, drapes, and everything inside the home. Control the Glare. Too much sunlight makes it difficult to see. This can cause problems like eye strain, headaches, and overall discomfort. Furthermore, solar glare can make it hard to use computer screens, televisions, and electronic devices. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 glass have special anti-glare properties that allow sufficient visible light through, without being excessive. No need to use drapes or blinds, which otherwise diminish the visual benefit of windows in the first place. Glare Control Comparisons Glare Control Glass Rejects most solar heat, controls glare. Rooms stay cool, comfy and attractive. Grey Tinted Glass Cuts sunlight by 50%, but poor solar heat control. Glass temperatures can exceed 100°F. Clear Glass Transmits 80% of solar energy. No glare control, no protection. Blinds required. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 Cut Out Unwanted Parts of the Spectrum Ultraviolet (UV) UV is invisible and makes upabout 3% of the total solar energy. This region of wavelengths is typically associated with fading of fabrics, paints, furniture, and other household items. Visible Light This portion of the solar spectrum makes up about 45% of total solar energy. Near Infrared (NIR) NIR is approximately 52% of the solar energy and invisible to the eye. What makes these glass coatings different is their ability to handle each portion of the solar spectrum differently.The plot shows the “spectrally selective” nature of the LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 coatings. They cut down heat-inducing infrared light and nearly eliminate ultraviolet transmission, while maintaining a proportionately high level of the visible range. LoĒ²-240 LoĒ3-340 84% 98% Blocks over 84% 98% of the harmful UV radiation. 60% 60% Rejects 60% 60% of the visible light, which gives the coating excellent glare control. ~92% ~99% Rejects nearly all the heat producing infrared rays. UV LIGHT VISIBLE LIGHT NIR LIGHT Grey Tinted Glass Clear Glass Wavelength (Nanometers) Light Spectrum Enjoy all season comfort. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 control more than the sun. During cold weather, their advanced coating design also provides an extremely low U-Factor to deliver comfort and energy savings. Year-round thermal comfort is a result of warm glass temperatures in the winter, cool glass temperatures in the summer, and the blockage of oppressive solar heat gains. Note in the chart below that the solar blockage for single pane tinted glass is marginal, and the extreme temperature fluctuations can lead to serious year-round comfort problems.

A double-pane window with a conventional tinted glass improves some solar blockage but leaves the building occupants exposed to hot glass temperatures in the summer. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 are placed on the #2 surface (air-space side of outdoor pane) and provides the best comfort through all the seasons. Get ready for maximum solar comfort If you envision your home’s design benefiting from a tinted glass for glare control, both LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 offer a great combination of aesthetic appeal along with energy performance and indoor comfort.

Double glazing improves the winter comfort, especially when a low emittance LoĒ² coating is used. A double-pane window with a conventional tinted glass and low-e on the #3 surface (air space side of indoor pane) improves the solar blockage but leaves the building occupants exposed to hot glass temperatures in the summer. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 are placed on the #2 surface (air-space side of outdoor pane) and provide the best comfort through all the seasons. Less heat gain when it’s hot, less heat loss when it’s cold, more comfort year-round, and the best glare control under the sun. LoĒ²-240 and LoĒ³-340 can be purchased in heat- strengthened, tempered, and laminated glass configurations, with a variety of shapes and sizes.

A large portion of the exposed surface of a window is glass, and the temperature of the room side of the glass directly affects the air temperature in the room. The better insulated the window glass, the warmer your room will be. Inside Glass and Outside Temperatures IG Type and Coating Double Pane, Clear Ordinary low-e, Clear LoĒ-180, Clear (Argon Fill) Inside Glass Temperature : °F °C -20 °F Very Cold Outside -30 °C Very Cold Outside 20 °F Cold Outside -10 °C Very Cold Outside 37°F 2°C 51°F 9°C 46°F 7°C 57°F 13°C 51°F 60°F 10°C 15°C The superior insulating capability of Cardinal LoĒ-180 is a key factor in the construction of comfortable windows for cold climates. The dramatic comfort improvement from windows with warm glass surfaces also means the relative humidity of the indoor air can be controlled and maintained properly. Proper humidity levels (not too much, not too little) will improve comfort and promote a healthier living environment. Blocks out the cold, lets in the solar warmth. Cardinal LoĒ-180 delivers outstanding cold weather performance – its insulation value is excellent with a low 0.26 U-Factor. And with an SHGC of 0.69, it lets the winter sun’s heat pass into the home. It also blocks 71 percent of the sun’s harmful UV rays. While blocking out the cold and UV rays, it lets the daylight stream in – more light than ordinary low-e glass. Our unique coating stops thermal loss Cardinal employs a state-of-the-art sputter coating process that is unmatched by any other glass manufacturer. The glass is coated with a microscopically thin, optically transparent layer of silver sandwiched between layers of anti-reflective metal oxide coatings. A protective coating is applied to assure durability and long life. The coating is virtually invisible to the eye – it’s just like looking through clear glass.

It offers excellent visible light transmittance and low reflectance. Yet it delivers a center-of-glass U-factor of just 0.20 when coupled with our LoĒ³ or LoĒ² glass and argon fill in a 2-pane unit.Even without argon and with or without capillary tubes, the unit still delivers a U-factor of just 0.23 – perfect for high altitudes. When regular LoĒ coated windows include room-side LoĒ-i89, more windows can meet the strict ENERGY STAR 7.0 requirements.What’s more, LoĒ-i89 is easy to clean. It’s as scratch resistant as regular annealed glass. And there’s no haze to mar the view. That’s LoĒ-i89, our enhanced winter performance glass. Double-pane windows becometriple-pane performers. With LoĒ-i89, you have more options. There’s less need to go to triple-pane windows to meet the various energy-saving guidelines. No need to invest in redesigning your windows and altering your manufacturing processes either. A double-pane IG unit with LoĒ-i89 can meet the guidelines for most climate zones. LoĒ-i89 is sputtered onto the indoor lite, the #4 surface, thus reflecting escaping heat back into the room and lowering U-factors. Coupled with our LoĒ² or LoĒ³ glass and argon fill, this double-pane unit delivers performance much better than clear triple-pane – a center of glass U-factor of just 0.20 compared to 0.37 with clear triple-pane.To surpass the U-factor performance of our LoĒ-i89 double-pane unit, you would need to go to a triple-pane unit with a low-E coating in each gap. But for maximum thermal control, a triple-pane IG with LoĒ-i89 on the #6 surface provides unmatched performance. Heat is reflected, not lost. OrdinaryClear Glass The advantages are more than clear. In addition to providing maximum energy efficiency in a double-pane unit, LoĒ-i89 offers several other customer-pleasing benefits.Its surface is smooth and scratch resistant, making it easier to remove label residue and clean. And perhaps most importantly, there’s no haze to mar the view.Rather than absorbing internal heat, LoĒ-i89 reflects it back into the room, making your living space feel warmer and more comfortable. Naturally, Endur IG units with LoĒ-i89 live up to the Cardinal reputation for long-range durability, delivering the industry’s lowest failure rate – only 0.20% over 20 years.Give homeowners another reason to love LoĒ-i89 units – include Neat+® naturally clean glass on the outside. Your windows stay cleaner longer and clean easier. Finally, protect your windows in transit as well as on the job site with Preserve® protective film. LoĒ-i89 and Interior Condensation High relative humidity (RH) in a home can cause condensation on interior glass surfaces, with outdoor ambient temperature and indoor room temperature also playing a role. LoĒ-i89, which reflects interior heat, can make the room-side glass surface cooler and increase condensation risk during winter. To prevent condensation, the U.S. ENERGY STAR program advises maintaining 30-40% relative humidity in colder climates. LoĒ-i89 is always paired with a regular LoĒ coating, and delivers glass temperatures high enough to resist indoor condensation.

Cardinal’s LoĒ²® coated glass delivers year-round comfort in any weather. In summer, it rejects the sun’s heat and damaging UV rays. In winter, it reflects heat back into the room. Cardinal’s LoĒ²-272 offers a bit more light transmittance, while LoĒ²-270 gives a little more solar control. Regardless of your location, choosing windows that provide the highest level of comfort and energy savings year-round is important. Choosing the right glass is the most crucial factor. So go beyond ordinary low-E glass. Let LoĒ² glass help you handle the weather – any weather. Hot sun? Cool windows. When the temperature is heading to the top of the thermometer, ordinary window glass lets the heat through. Cardinal LoĒ², however, is formulated to reject the sun’s heat and damaging rays and keep your home cool and comfortable. Frigid outside, cozy inside. During cold weather, the insulating effect of your windows has a direct impact on how your rooms feel. Typically, the largest exposed surface of a window is glass, and the temperature of the room-side of the glass directly affects the air temperature in the room. The better insulated the window glass, the warmer your room will be. To maintain comfort during the winter, select a glass that produces surface temperatures that stay above this point during the coldest outdoor conditions.

GENERAL NOTES: (1) Data was calculated using the LBNL Window computer program per NFRC environmental conditions. (2) 90% argon/10% air fill is used for IG’s with LoE coated glass, otherwise 100% air fill is used for uncoated units. The difference is clear. Cardinal LoĒ² glass is ideal for all weather conditions in most climates. In summer, its patented coating blocks around 85% of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays and 60% of the sun’s heat. It even outperforms tinted glass often used in warm climates. You can see out and the light shines in, with no heavy bronze or smoke-colored tones to darken the personality of your home. In winter, it reflects heat back into rooms. LoĒ² glass can be purchased in heat-strengthened, tempered, and laminated glass configurations, with a variety of shapes and sizes.To learn more about LoĒ² and other Cardinal glass products, ask your window manufacturer, contractor, or architect.

It keeps homes warmer and more comfortable by blocking heat loss to the outside and letting the sun’s heat stream in. With a glass U-Factor of just 0.26 and an SHGC of 0.71, LoĒ-180ESC is the ideal product for passive solar applications in Canada. Glass Made for ENERGY STAR 2020 Requirements in Canada ENERGY STAR version 5.0, issued by Natural Resources Canada (NrCan), went into effect on January 1, 2020. The improved energy efficiency requirements can be met with either a maximum U-Factor of 1.22 (W/m²·K) / 0.21 (BTU/hr·ft²·°F) or minimum Energy Rating (ER) of 34 for the window or door. Meeting this low U-Factor would require a triple pane insulating glass unit. A dual pane option can meet the minimum 34 Energy Rating, requiring the window to balance a high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with a low U-Factor. To match the updated and expanded ENERGY STAR Canada guidelines, Cardinal CG has developed the LoĒ–180ESC coating. It’s engineered to help more windows and doors meet the new Energy Rating of 34 throughout Canada. LoĒ–180ESC is a 3rd surface coating for a dual pane unit which allows more energy from the sun to enter the home while the low U-Factor keeps the heat in. Blocks out the cold, lets in the light. Cardinal LoĒ-180ESC delivers outstanding cold weather performance – its insulation value is excellent with a low 0.26 U-Factor. And with an SHGC of 0.71, it lets the winter sun’s heat pass into the home. It also blocks 75 percent of the sun’s harmful UV rays. While blocking out the cold and UV rays, it lets the daylight stream in – more light than ordinary low-e glass. Our unique coating stops thermal loss Cardinal employs a state-of-the-art sputter coating process that is unmatched by any other glass manufacturer. The glass is coated with a microscopically thin, optically transparent layer of silver sandwiched between layers of anti-reflective metal oxide coatings. A protective coating is applied to assure durability and long life. The coating is virtually invisible to the eye – it’s just like looking through clear glass.

The smaller the number, the better the window system is at reducing heat loss. Cardinal CG has additional products and configurations to further improve the Energy Rating if LoĒ-180ESC by itself isn’t enough. Some windows won’t meet the ER ≥ 34 regardless of the glass configurations or products due to the design of the window, which could include frame materials, dividers and air loss. In that case, please consult with your window manufacturer for window design guidance. LoĒ-180ESC Helps Meet New Requirements LoĒ-180ESC is the perfect glass to be both comfortable and compliant with the new requirements for Canada ENERGY STAR. To learn more about LoĒ-180ESC and other Cardinal Glass products, ask your window manufacturer, contractor or architect.

So we now offer a new option for the Canadian residential market. It is called LoĒ-Di89™, a new application of our LoĒ-i89™ coating. LoĒ-Di89 glass gives manufacturers that extra nudge over LoĒ-180ESC™ to meet Canada code compliance. Canadian ENERGY STAR 5.0 Requirements For Canada, ENERGY STAR version 5.0 went into effect on January 1, 2020. These new requirements mean that windows and doors now must meet a minimum Energy Rating (ER) of 34. To meet that condition, dual pane units need to balance a high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with a low U-Factor. LoĒ-Di89: Made for Canada LoĒ-Di89 is engineered to help more windows and doors meet the new Energy Rating of 34 throughout Canada. LoĒ-Di89 is a coating applied to the 3rd and 4th surface of a dual pane unit which allows more energy from the sun to enter the home while the low U-Factor keeps the heat in. LoĒ-Di89 is available in a variety of custom shapes and sizes and can be heat-strengthened or tempered. In some configurations heat-strengthening may be recommended to mitigate against the effects of thermal stress. Performance Matters The design of a window or door requires a careful selection of materials like the sash, frame, decorative bars, as well as the glass. All of these pieces can affect the total performance values of a completed product. Therefore, some glazing options can be more advantageous for particular designs over others. With LoĒ-Di89 glass, the advantage lies in the combination of a very high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and a very low U-Factor. The high SHGC allow more passive heat from the sun to enter the home, and the low U-Factor helps retain heat within the home’s interior.

The smaller the number, the better the window system is at reducing heat loss. The table shows how LoĒ-Di89 provides a very low U-Factor with a high SHGC, which contributes to the overall ER of the finished window or door.Note that LoĒ-Di89 provides a better combination of high SHGC and low U-Factor, contributing more to a higher ER than even LoĒ-180ESC or LoĒ-180ESC/LoĒ-i89. More Options for Better Results For window and door companies who sell in the Canadian market, LoĒ-Di89 glass is one of many wise choices for energy-efficient windows. Not only does it provide great insulting value with a high solar passive design, it makes it easier for more product designs to meet the advanced ENERGY STAR codes for 2020.To best understand how LoĒ-Di89 can fit into your overall fenestration needs for windows and doors, please contact your window manufacturer, contractor or architect.

A New Generation, Available Now. Neat+ Glass is the latest generation of lower maintenance glass. With Neat+, glass is naturally cleaner. Since 2006, more than 57 million windows with Neat glass have been sold, serving as the leading product for low maintenance glass. It Pays for Itself in Reclaimed Weekends. Mother Nature + Science =Cleaner Windows. Window cleaning is a chore. Exterior window surfaces require constant maintenance, but not so with Neat+ glass. Neat+ means glass stays cleaner longer. And when you must clean your glass, it’ll be easier and fast. Neat+ uses a combination of static dissipation to reduce the amount of dust on the window’s surface, along with help from the sun to break down greenhouse gases and other pollutants to keep the window naturally cleaner. Conductive Surface: 40% Less Dust. Neat+ is more conductive than uncoated glass, which results in a dissipation of static charge on the surface. Test results from an outside lab show 40% less dust on the Neat+ surface compared to uncoated glass. This means cleaner windows. The homeowner also uses less water and fewer cleaning chemicals, which save time, money, and environmental resources. Ordinary Glass Regular glass surface can be statically charged and attract dust particles Neat + Anti-Static Neat+ is a conductive surface, so dustparticles are not attracted, reducing buildup TiO2 Coating: Advanced Photoactivity. The titanium dioxide layer of Neat+ glass reacts chemically with the sun’s UV rays and causes greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are on the glass to decompose. Neat+ is 25% more photoactive than the original Neat glass. How Neat+ Works The anti-static Neat+ surface reduces dust buildup by 40% Even if you don’t clean your windows regularly, Neat+ means your glass stays cleaner longer When exposed to sunlight, the Neat+ surface actively produces hydroxyl groups which chemically break down greenhouse gases and other pollutants Neat+ Glass Is the Greener Choice. In addition to decomposing greenhouse pollutants, Cardinal’s Neat+ fabrication methods also contribute to environmental efficiency.Cardinal’s patented double-sputtering process permanently deposits silicon and titanium dioxide on the bottom of the glass during the same pass through the coater as our energy-efficient LoĒ coatings, reducing the amount of energy needed to coat both glass surfaces. The combination of Neat+ and LoĒ keeps windows cleaner longer while providing energy savings to the homeowner. LoĒ Comfort and Efficiency.

Compare Break Patterns Laminated glass can withstand strong impacts. But what happens after glass shatter also contributes to your personal safety. Annealed Breakage When ordinary annealed glass breaks, the large resulting fragments pose a threat to personal safety. Tempered Breakage Tempered glass reduces risk by resisting breakage and breaks into small, benign pieces. Laminated Breakage Laminated glass does more: it is the type of safety glazing that also remains intact within the window frame. LAMINATED GLASS IS A SUPERIORSOLUTION TO SAFETY GLAZING Lami + Tempered = Maximum Safety Laminated glass can also be customized with tempered panes to provide even more protection. Cardinal Tempered Glass Page Specifications Cardinal certifies its laminated safety glass products through the Safety Glazing Certification Council (SGCC). The SGCC is an independent agency which confirms that safety glass meets the following industry safety standards: 1 ANSI Z97.1 Class “A” and CPSC 16CFR 1201 Cat II – laminated glass with 0.030” interlayer and thicker 2 ANSI Z97.1 Class “B” and CPSC 16 CFR 1201 Cat – laminated glass with 0.015” interlayer For more information about Cardinal’s laminated glass for safety applications, please contact one of our Cardinal LG facilities.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Laminated Glass for Railings CARDINAL LG COMPANY Glass Railings Glass Railings that Clear the View Cardinal LG provides laminated glass for railings as an attractive and classy option for contemporary buildings. We fabricate the glass for maximum safety and attractiveness. Newest Performance Requirements In the past, handrail manufacturers designed rail systems with monolithic tempered glass. While tempered is stronger than annealed glass, the problem of fallout damage still exists in the rare event of glass breakage. Since 2015, code requirements from the International Building Code stipulate the use of tempered or heat-strengthened laminated glass in most railing applications. Cardinal’s laminated glass meets this code and is an excellent choice for railings in structural glass applications, exposed edge laminates, floors, and stairs. With high performance structural interlayers, railings with Cardinal laminated glass are built to withstand the most intense impacts. This is due to their post-breakage strength, high film shear strength and edge stability that other glass types do not offer. Fight Moisture Damage When selecting laminated glass, it is vital to consider the application. For an indoor railing, structural PVB is suitable due to having great structural and post breakage performance at room temperatures.In outdoor scenarios, interlayers like SentryGlas® and structrual PVBs (e.g., Saflex DG41) are ideal. This is due to their increased structural and post-breakage properties over a wide range of temperatures and superior edge stability. Framed and Frameless Railings Cardinal laminated glass can be utilized in both framed and frameless railing applications. Framed glass railings are often used for a luxury appearance while being budget friendly. They can be installed easily in inside and outside environments and feature handrails and posts. Framed Glass Railings Frameless railings are highly desirable due to their ultra-modern look. When installed on balconies, frameless railings also offer uninterrupted views and minimal maintenance. Frameless Railings Rejection rate among frameless railings is an industry-wide challenge, but due to careful quality control, laminated glass by Cardinal has a superior edge quality to protect its frameless laminated glass from failing. Full Service Manufacturing Cardinal LG’s offers complete production services for your design requirements. For more information about Cardinal’s laminated glass for railings, please contact one of our LG facilities.

Damage caused to glass doors and windows from wayward debris during hurricanes is common, and these calamitous events can have a profound impact on the overall structural integrity of homes. A breach in a window opening can lead to a monumental pressure increase inside the home, that at worst can lift off the roof and push out the walls. Cardinal’s Sea-Storm® is a reinforced defensive glazing that provides impressive resistance to hurricane winds. Enhanced Protection Against Windborne Debris Unlike annealed and tempered varieties, Sea-Storm remains structurally sound when damaged by blunt force and puncture impacts. The robust interlayer provides stability when panes are damaged, allowing for the product to stay intact and your home habitable. Sea-Storm passes the most rigorous county building codes designed for hurricane-prone areas. It also contributes to being compliant with the TAS 201, TAS 203, ASTM E1886, and ASTM E1996 testing protocols. PHOTO CREDIT : JOHNNY MILANO When a building is breached through a broken window, wind can enter the building and create a sudden pressure increase that lifts the roof and pushes the walls outward, causing the building to collapse. Sea-Storm impact-rated laminated glass helps preserve the building envelope, minimizing the damage.

Dangerous Noise Levels 70 dB 80 dB 85 dB 100 dB 120 dB Noise level above 70 dB over a prolonged period could start to damage your hearing 125 dB 130 dB Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears 70 dB Noise level above 70 dB over a prolonged period could start to damage your hearing 80 dB 85 dB 100 dB 120 dB Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears 125 dB 130 dB The Science of Sound Control Laminated glass attenuates sound thanks to its sturdy interlayer. This greatly reduces audio decibel levels and is extremely useful in high-noise areas, such as near major roads, airports, and manufacturing centers. And when paired with a sealed IG unit, Cardinal’s laminated glass renders even greater sound dampening. STC and OITC are standards that measure sound attenuation. Widely used STC (Sound Transmission Class) measures frequencies from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. OITC (Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class) is a more modern and “real world” test that includes sounds on the lower end of the spectrum, from 80 to 4000 Hz. In both cases, the higher the number, the better the sound deadening effects. Strict Performance Testing Note how glass thickness and interlayer configurations affect sound control. Higher STC/OITC numbers are better.

However, Cardinal’s laminated glass products cut most fade-inducing rays and protects your interior long term. ORDINARY GLASS UV causes fading over time LAMINATED GLASS Protects interiors for years Measuring Fade Resistance Fading potential from the sun is often measured through Ultraviolet Light Transmittance (UVT) and Damaged Weighted Transmission (Tdw-ISO) testing. Single pane clear glass with a UVT of 73% allows most of the UV energy to come through into the room, offering very little protection. Single-pane clear glass Cardinal Laminated Glass Minimal Fade Resistance Enhanced UV Protection But laminated glass is optimized to block most of the sun’s fade damaging rays so that your interior remains unblemished. For maximum fade control, laminated glass can incorporate LoĒ coatings in an IG configuration. This combination reduces glare, solar heat gain, and thermal loss while still allowing pleasant visible light to illuminate your rooms. Glass Configuration Single Pane, Clear LoĒ3-366, Clear Mono Lami (7.8L) LoĒ3-366 + Lami (7.8L) UV Transmission 73% 5% <1% <1% Fade (Tdw-ISO) 85% 43% 61% 39% GENERAL NOTES: (1) Data calculated using LBNL Window computer program per NFRC environmental conditions.

Cardinal’s CT glass operations provide consistent high quality tempered glass that can be made in nearly any configuration. More importantly our process capabilities allow for short lead times and quick delivery demanded by today’s custom design market. Quadrupled Strength In the tempering process, glass is heated to approximately 1200° F (650° C) and then rapidly cooled with air. This locks the outer surface of the glass in compression which dramatically increases glass strength.Fully tempered glass is four times stronger than a piece of annealed glass. When it breaks, it separates into small pieces as a break-safe pattern, reducing likelihood of injury. Annealed glass break pattern (not safety certified) Tempered glass break pattern (meets safety criteria) Cardinal’s tempered glass meets important safety codes. ANSI Z-97.1-2009 CPSC 16 CFR 1201 categories I and II Glass Compression and Tension Zones Glass tempering makes the exterior surface go into compression and the interior into tension. Fully tempered glass has a surface compression of 10,000 psi. Heat-Strengthened Glass Unlike tempering, heat strengthening is an intermediate level of compression that doubles the strength and can provide flatter glass with better aesthetics. Heat strengthening is not considered safety glazing as it will break into large shards like ordinary annealed glass. Cardinal’s Manufacturing All of Cardinal’s fabrication centers are equipped for glass tempering needs. Cardinal also operates stand-alone tempering centers to further expand our service levels: 10 Cardinal CT locations for custom tempering operations 3 Cardinal TG facilities for high volume tempering This massive capacity means that we’re capable of fulfilling any size tempered glass order at any time. Advantages of Cardinal’s Tempered Glass There are multiple reasons to choose Cardinal’s custom tempering services: Quality Assurance Our Intelligent Quality program ensures that each tempered pane is free of defects, distortion, and color abnormalities. Manufacturing Flexibility Our tempering lines are in various geographic centers in the United States, meaning shorter lead times for product fulfillment.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Float Glass CARDINAL FG COMPANY Defect-Free Raw Glass Quality from the Beginning Top of the line residential window manufacturers rely on a constant supply of high-quality float glass. At Cardinal FG Company, such quality is what you can expect–our seven U.S. FG facilities will provide it for you every time. The pursuit of perfect glass Cardinal looks ahead of the industry by using new technologies that will meet even tomorrow’s marketplace. Our constant growing spirit takes glass manufacturing to a higher level. Our modern furnace design gives Cardinal an excellent system for producing float glass in a 24/7 environment. The capabilities built into the process give our operations maximum flexibility to produce the many different thicknesses of glass – from 1.6 to 7mm that are required for the residential market. A vision of excellence fromproduction to shipping. Our practical packing system preserves glass quality. State-of-the-art glass packing is done on automatic or manual spur lines, depending on size. The need for clean production has resulted in a system that minimizes contact with glass surfaces during the packing phase. A capping system uses 90° rotators, barrel turnovers, robots, and stackers to ensure proper glass orientation for downstream operations. Our computerized inventory program provides accurate supply intelligence down to the very lite. The glass warehouse accommodates storage of up to 25,000 tons of glass for our customers. To ensure that we have the proper on-hand inventory, we have a tracking and stock locator system that connects this inventory with current and projected customer demands. Our patented rack system minimizes handling. To reduce the times a pack of glass is handled, we introduced a system called a collapsible A-frame. It ships the glass from our floor via standard sized trailers directly to the customer’s line for processing. The racks need minimal separating or bracing materials, which saves time and factory space in the process and reduces waste. Intelligent Quality In addition, with our exclusive Intelligent Quality (IQ) program, customers can depend on the quality and consistency that our products are known for. IQ represents a series of quality control processes that guarantee that glass always meets or exceeds specifications. In our float glass facilities, we installed IQ inspection systems in these areas: Did you know? Float glass plants are enormous–over 350,000 square feet under each roof. Each plant uses $500,000 of natural gas and $85,000 of electricity every month. Float plants run nonstop 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Each FG plant ships 35-40 trucks of glass every day, at almost 35,000 square feet per truck. Glass is cut in sizes as small as 16″ x 20″ to as large as 130″ x 204″. These systems as well as our industry-leading inspection processes are the assurance that Cardinal glass will exceed specification and expectation. Great glass helps make great windows, so manufacturing superior float glass is always our stated goal.

Over time, surface corrosion caused by this exposure can essentially “age” the glass, resulting in a dull and dirty appearance that worsens the longer the exposure exists.This anti-corrosion solution is also ideal for shower glass doors. Now available with Purevision® low-iron glass. Limited Lifetime Warranty With Ordinary Glass, Cleaning Alone Won’t Work. As glass is made from sand, it contains sodium in large quantities. When water enters in contact with sodium it progressively damages. With Cardinal HydroClear, a permanent coating is applied to the glass to protect the surface against this corrosion. HydroClear and clear float glass were tested at high temperatures and high humidity to simulate regular use in a shower enclosure for 20 years. Unlike the clear float glass, HydroClear showed no signs of corrosion. Applications Glass Enclosures Exterior Railings Showers Bathrooms Glass Enclosures Exterior Railings Showers Bathrooms HydroClear Benefits HydroClear glass provides a superior solution to water-exposed glass surfaces: Prevents unsightly corrosion from water, heat, and high humidity. When fabricated withPurevision low-iron floatglass, a high visibility,color-neutral look. Permanently hardened surface works overmany decades, with alimited lifetimewarranty.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors U.S. ENERGY STAR 7.0 U.S. ENERGY STAR 7.0 Guidance for Windows The ENERGY STAR 7.0 specification represents a significant update to EPA standards. ENERGY STAR-certified products will need to meet even more stringent U-factor and SHGC requirements than before. Window and door manufacturers can now prepare their product lines to meet the new certification standards. This document provides general guidance to select the right insulating glass and LoĒ glass coatings to meet the new criteria. What’s New Effective date: October 23, 2023 Each of the four climate zones have updated boundaries More stringent U-factor and SHGC requirements across all climate zones New ENERGY STAR 7.0 Climate Zones NORTHERN NORTH-CENTRAL SOUTH-CENTRAL SOUTHERN For a detailed list of county zone assignments, see the ENERGY STAR website. ENERGY STAR 7.0 Requirements for Windows Climate Zone U-Factor SHGC Northern ≤ 0.22 ≥ 0.17 = 0.23 ≥ 0.35 = 0.24 = 0.25 ≥ 0.40 = 0.26 North-Central ≤ 0.25 ≤ 0.40 South-Central ≤ 0.28 ≤ 0.23 Southern ≤ 0.32 ≤ 0.23 Prescriptive Equivalent Energy Performance For the Northern zone, a manufacturer can choose ‘equivalent energy performance’ criteria which should match the annual energy performance of the ‘prescriptive’ criteria. This offers more flexibility in window selection. Cardinal’s Product Selection Tool The following table describes the LoĒ coatings and IG configurations that could meet the new criteria. This information assumes that the IG unit is configured with an energy-efficient window frame and is properly installed. Connect the LoĒ coated glass on the left with the correct climate zone column. Examples here use 3mm glass with a stainless steel spacer and argon gas fill. 2 Pane Only need a 2-pane IG unit with the specified LoĒ coating. 2p i89 Need a 2-pane IG with LoĒ coating and room-side LoĒ-i89. 3 Pane Need a 3-pane IG unit with the specified LoĒ coating. This configuration cannot be used for ENERGY STAR 7.0. Northern North Central South Central Southern Prescriptive Equivalent Energy Performance Prescriptive U-Factor ≤ 0.22 = 0.23 = 0.24 = 0.25 = 0.26 ≤ 0.25 ≤ 0.28 ≤ 0.32 SHGC ≥ 0.17 ≥ 0.35 ≥ 0.35 ≥ 0.40 ≥ 0.40 ≤ 0.40 ≤ 0.23 ≤ 0.23 Quad LoĒ-452+ 2p i89 2 Pane 2 Pane LoĒ³-366 3 Pane 2p i89 2 Pane 2 Pane LoĒ³-340 2p i89 2 Pane 2 Pane LoĒ²-240 2p i89 2p i89 2 Pane LoĒ²-270 3 Pane 2p i89 LoĒ²-272 3 Pane 2p i89 LoĒ-180 3 Pane 3 Pane 3 Pane 2p i89 2p i89 We’re Here to Help When using this data, keep in mind that the entire window assembly, including the frame, sash, decorative bars, and other hardware can influence the overall performance numbers.This document will be updated periodically to reflect any adjustments to Cardinal’s product lines.Additional questions from window and door manufacturers can be provided through Cardinal CG Technical Services or your sales representative.Page Updated: 05/16/2023 X Company About Cardinal Careers Locations About Cardinal Careers Locations More Info Privacy Policy Privacy Notice for CA Residents Terms and Conditions / Warranties For Consumers Privacy Policy Privacy Notice for CA Residents Terms and Conditions / Warranties For Consumers NEW FEATURE ON OUR SITE Facebook Linkedin Twitter English (UNITED STATES) COPYRIGHT © 2023 BY CARDINAL GLASS INDUSTRIES, INC Manage Cookie Consent To provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Emissions Conformance: It’s our commitment towards environment friendly production throughout our facilities. Temperature Control: This is managed by our lehr pyrometer system. It controls glass temperatures and the width of the ribbon, which are critical in the annealing process and minimize our cutting losses. Annealing Process: It provides a uniformed glass temperature. This cooling process helps create the inherent strength of the glass and maximizes the ability to cut the finished product. 3 Strain Measurements: These accommodate the strain on the ribbon that affects the cutting of the glass. The Lehr pyrometer system controls glass temperatures. Thickness Profile: Controls the thickness across the ribbon and determines if any portion is out of spec. Edges On and Off Squareness: It accounts for edge quality and squareness specs. Optimization System: The process arbitrates the best cut for the ribbon, which helps maximize production and efficiency in order to keep costs down. Defect Detection: Is a laser system inspection of 100% of the glass. It detects defects, ribbon edges, knurl mark and distortion. By reading the “zebra” pattern across the ribbon, there is minimal distortion and stays within spec.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors IQ – Coated Glass IQ - Coated Glass IQ Systems for Coated Glass Clean Start: Glass must be exceptionally clean. Our coater washers feature a unique water stream particle size counter that detects minute particles and quantify them. Exterior Color: Exterior color is validated in process as well as off-line. This specific technology provides analysis based on how the completed product will appear in a consumer’s home. Production measurements enable us to statistically control the existing process and use the data as benchmark for continuous improvement efforts. Room Side Color and Visible Transmission/Reflection: Involves a continuous load-to-load monitoring to validate film stack construction. IR Reflection: Validates and ensures coating performance. Lucite Density: “Lucite interleaving density” is managed and placed between sheets of glass. To calculate and maintain proper coverage density, light emitting diodes (LED) illuminate the material then high-speed cameras capture images several times per second. The proper density provides protection against transportation and handling related damages, which can happen when one piece of glass touches another. In-process performance testing is continuous and recorded into our electronic Quality Management System. Supply Chain Quality System: Extends our quality philosophy to our vendors. Electronic systems make direct evaluation performance available to our vendors and customers. Edge Deletion: Cardinal’s proprietary technology allows for as many as ten measurements per second. Consequently, we can trend drift and tool wear. Statistically managing this process ensures that the customers will not incur edge delete issues such as sealing an unprepared surface. Optimization System: The process arbitrates the best cut for the ribbon, which helps maximize production and efficiency in order to keep costs down. Performance Testing: R&D conducted evaluations look at every potential variable that can arise along the way. Customized for production in process testing is continuous and recorded into our electronic Quality Management System.

Tempering furnace washers feature a unique water stream particle size counter that can detect minute particles and quantifies them. Hawkeye Camera: This high-resolution, high-speed camera is used to detect scratches, coating faults and debris on the surface. Tempered Distortion: Competitive inspection systems read the peaks and valleys that develop as part of the tempering process but they report only an average. And not all lites are measured. Our state-of-the-art camera system measures the entire glass, focusing on a series of circles (similar to pixels). The results represent what the human eye sees. Our state-of-the-art camera system measures glass defects. Tempered Glass Orientation: This camera system measures the lites, matches them against the production schedule and assigns identification to our operators. This is used in packaging to prevent and eliminate confusion and mistakes. Defect Detection: The system accurately characterizes defects by size and sorts them according to our specifications. This prevents defective glass from proceeding to high value operation. Tempered Conformance: All Cardinal tempering facilities equip a photo elastic stress measuring system that identifies areas of non-uniform stress in the glass. Inadequate tempering is highlighted. The system stops unqualified glass products to leave our facility. Furthermore, it allows us to reconfigure procedures as necessary to obtain better heating and quenching. In return, our customers receive high quality tempered glass every time. .

Our washers feature automated water quality tracking systems that monitor PH levels and electrical conductivity. Automated Glass Defect Detection: This is where scratches, coating faults and debris on glass surface are detected. The systems accurately characterize defects by size and sort them according to specifications preventing defective glass from proceeding to high value operations. Unit Thickness: Our Assembly Gas Press (AGP) ensures the precise thickness of each IG unit to within thousandths of an inch. Cardinal’s Assembly Gas Press improves IG unit construction quality by automating three processes into one. Argon Fill Levels: This system measures the argon fill levels of IG units and verifies initial fill rates. Coating Color: A spectrophotometer checks color intensity and hue. To avoid rejection of the unit, each different coating must meet specific color values. Center of Glass Thickness: Where possible we do a 100% inspection of all important attributes, including unit or center of glass thickness. If the unit fails, it is not sealed.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors History History History of Cardinal Glass Industries Explore Humble Beginnings In the early 1960s, window manufacturers were experiencing an increasing demand for the convenience of insulating glass instead of storm windows. Existing IG providers, such as PPG and Libby Owens Ford (LOF) had product lead times of about a year.Thus, ML Gordon Sash and Door Company decided to manufacture its own insulating glass units. In 1962, it created the subsidiary Cardinal Insulated Glass Co. A year later, Roger O’Shaughnessy joined Cardinal, which at the time had 12 employees, and in 1967, Mr. Gordon selected Roger to be the new president.Since then, Cardinal has progressed from being a small facility in St. Louis Park Minnesota to being a worldwide provider of advanced glass solutions.

For example, where you contest the accuracy of your personal information, its use may be restricted until the accuracy is verified.

In order to protect the privacy and data security of consumers, the verifiable consumer request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of such consumer; and Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select the format of our response; the format will be readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another. We will not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing the request.

Pre-applied on Cardinal insulating glass (IG) units, Preserve film protects everybody’s interests. It also protects your relationship with the homeowner, as they get undamaged, clean windows every time. On the job site, stuff happens. Spattered paint. Excess stucco. Slopped mud. Scratched glass. By the time construction is over, the windows are a mess.Post-construction cleanup is an annoyance, as you spend time and money cleaning instead of moving to the next job.But if your windows are covered with Preserve, cleanup is a snap. When the job is over, builders simply peel off Preserve and throw it away– along with all the grime, even the labels. From the Factory through Customer Handover We at Cardinal and our window manufacturers take care to ensure that glass leaves factories in flawless condition.Preserve is the clear solution to window protection. This patented film defends your glass. Factory-applied to both the outer and inner surfaces in overlapping layers, it ensures that the entire glass surface is protected all the way through the phases of construction, up to client approval. The fast and furious are not always the careful and cautious. Construction crews. Hard-working, sure. Careful, not always. By the time everyone is finished, the windows are filthy. In addition, labels create “ghosting,” leaving a distracting visual blemish. Cleaning up this mess at the end of the job is a hassle, taking up valuable time and labor. Even worse, damaged glass must be reordered and replaced. Preserve solves this job-site dilemma. Because the film is applied at the factory, construction crews do not waste time applying and removing protective coverings such as tapes, films or sprays. Other makeshift fixes like newspaper or cardboard are also avoided, since they block out light.Preserve is clear, so natural light still shines into the interior of the structure. Preserve saves you time, money, and a lot of hassle. Without Preserve, glass generally requires at least two heavy-duty cleanings before a job is finished. A recent market research study found that Preserve could save hundreds of dollars per house in cleanup costs. Not exactly pocket change.With Preserve, you say goodbye to these time-wasting cleanups. At the end of construction, Preserve peels off, taking the accumulated dirt and labels with it. Clean windows can mean a shorter punch list. Finally, because Preserve contains no harmful chemicals or by-products, it can be disposed of with the rest of normal construction site debris.So Preserve your windows. It protects the glass, reduces cleanup times, and keeps your customers happy. And it helps deliver a beautiful home, with glistening and undamaged windows. Preserve Specifications Length min 10.0”, max unlimited Width min 4.5”, max unlimited Dimensional tolerances +/-0.25” Facts about Preserve Preserve incorporates a water-based adhesive and is rated as a low-density polyethylene. Preserve should be removed within six months of installation. Preserve should not be pressurewashed. Preserve contains no harmful chemicals or byproducts and can be disposed of with normal construction site debris. Do not affix permanent grilles or external fixtures directly to Preserve.

Acid should not be used on Preserve. Do not use razor blades to remove Preserve film which can scratch or score the glass.
