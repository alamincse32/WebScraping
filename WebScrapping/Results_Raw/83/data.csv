That way, your manufacturing operations are faster, more reliable and compliant.Cell & gene therapy as well as tissue engineering processes are usually highly complex and contain many manual steps. Moreover, skilled personnel for execution and review is hard to find, which can limit the scale up of production. To address these challenges, cell & gene companies rely on PAS-X MES, which facilitatesthe documentation of the process for the operators or lab personnel by barcode scanning, automatic tracking of users, chain of identity and chain of custodythe execution by operator guidance, automatic calculations and decisions, prevention of mix-ups, equipment checks and material usabilitythe review process for supervisors and quality departments by providing a process overview, reduced probability for documentation issues and real time review by exception Factsheet: Faster time to market through digitization of the complete product lifecycleWerum PAS-X MES and Werum PAS-X Savvy enable automated data analysis in cell & gene therapy manufacturing. By leveraging an iterative approach of process digitalization, data analysis, process optimization and validation, CGT companies can drastically reduce time to market. Download Covering the complete product lifecycleMost cell & gene therapy manufacturers who have implemented Werum PAS-X MES are using electronic batch recording (EBR) over the complete product lifecycle, beginning with clinical trials. During this phase, most manufacturers face constant changes to the process, which provides specific challenges for the implementation of a digital manufacturing system. Körber has developed a best practice approach to ensure that EBR is used efficiently and feasibly in all stages of the product lifecycle. By leveraging an iterative approach of process digitization, data analysis, process optimization and validation, our customers are able to drastically reduce time to market.lTogether with Körber, we are achieving our ambitious GMP technology roadmap that enables our teams to focus on the core business – the production of therapies for people with cancer.rKawa Chiu Vice President of CMC, Supply Chain and GMP Systems, LyellDigital data management to keep up with legal requirementsData management is particularly challenging for cell & gene therapy processes. Many new regulatory guidelines are frequently developed to stay abreast with new approvals. Furthermore, with the complex procedures, substantial amounts of data are generated and the different input material of many therapies leads to high process variability. By providing the data in a digital form early in the product lifecycle, PAS-X MES enables cell & gene therapy manufacturers to improve their data management. The digital data can be used directly with PAS-X Savvy or other data analysis tools.lWith Werum PAS-X MES, Walvax has been able to gain advantages in terms of compliance, process standardization and acceleration of batch release.rHuang Zhen, President Walvax Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

It is significantly more than just a manufacturing execution system (MES) software.Thanks to the modular structure of MES Suite and Intelligence Suite, content and services, PAS-X already offers preconfigured standard solutions for pharma, biotech, cell & gene, CMO and other production processes. We have solutions tailored to large companies as well as specific solutions for mid-sized and regional manufacturers.

Werum PAS-X is the agile, best-in-class solution that meets the needs of all industry segments and enterprise scales.

PAS-X is more than MES. It stands for an agile, best-in-class solution that offers exactly what customers need regardless of company size or industry focus.rJens Woehlbier, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Software, Körber Business Area PharmaThe pharma and biotech industries are facing enormous challenges: Large corporations in the pharma industry need to implement intelligent production line strategies across a wide variety of locations; regional mid-sized pharma enterprises want to be able to efficiently manage a large number of variants and materials; biotech and cell & gene therapy companies need to be able to produce and scale up small batches in unparalleled quality and on a fail-safe basis; and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) are under cost and time pressure to implement electronic systems and onboard new products. Due to their decades of experience, Körber’s software experts are able to fully grasp these challenges. They have further developed PAS-X in such a way that the specific challenges can be met – while requiring very little installation effort due to the use of preconfigured, industry-specific solutions. PAS-X includes a variety of different suites as for example MES Software Suite, Intelligence Software Suite, Content Suite, and Services Suite. Körber provides its customers with preconfigured solutions specifically tailored to their industry segment and business type: PAS-X Suites for pharma, biotech, cell & gene therapy manufacturers, for CMOs, or for midsized companies. When it comes to pharma digitalization, digital transformation of production processes, and network integration of production data, the market-leading Werum PAS-X Manufacturing Execution System (MES) software from Körber sets the standard for the industry. With its performance and versatility, PAS-X is entering a new dimension. This is possible because PAS-X is much more than a manufacturing execution system. With its many products for data management and analysis, the Werum PAS-X Intelligence Suite forms a reliable basis for the use of AI in areas such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology production. This allows customers to ensure problem-free production, to quickly resolve manufacturing problems, and to get the most out of their production process. Additional suites increase the versatility of PAS-X regardless of the industry segment or scale of the enterprise. The various suites offer software products for production management and data analysis, preconfigured content templates, and comprehensive services across the entire pharma value chain. Customers benefit from tailor-made solutions in regard to the challenges they are facing. This is because Körber assembles existing components such as software products, content templates, and services as required. It is then possible to offer industry-specific solutions for pharma and biotech companies, for cell & gene therapy manufacturers, and for contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). In this way, the software experts at Körber are expanding the PAS-X portfolio while offering existing customers and companies new to the market numerous benefits that are precisely tailored to the needs of the industry.

More accurate, space-saving, and up to five times faster than manual inspection: The Seidenader V90+ supports your operators in simultaneously checking multiple criteria such as foreign matter in the product, impurities and damage to a container’s sidewalls, bottom, shoulder or closure area. This is ensured by various illuminations, mirrors and a magnifying glass. Parameters such as rotation speed or light intensity are stored in the HMI along with the respective recipe and are automatically loaded to enable reproducible inspection settings. The high-speed rotation system, which is driven by a servo motor, swirls up foreign matter inside the liquid for particle inspection. The container then rotates around its axis at an individually adjustable speed in front of the operator for a 360° inspection, so that also cosmetic defects on the entire surface are detected. An LED feedback bar confirms the status of the container via colored luminous markings. This enables the operator to see at a glance whether he or she has marked the container as defective or not.If you want to inspect different products on your machine, it can be quickly and tool-free adapted to other formats. These factors make the difference Ergonomic design A magnifying glass enables the operator to easily detect even the smallest defects. With a swipe of the finger, he or she marks faulty containers, and the LED feedback bar displays the status. Reliable inspection Moveable mirrors, various lighting options, and individually adjustable speed support the process of monitoring a wide variety of inspection criteria.

It is gas-tight, VHP-proof, and optimized for laminar flow High efficiency Minimized machine downtimes and fewer rejects save time and money Raised stopper inspection: Optimum fit of the stopper for the following process step The raised stopper inspection from our Seidenader Solutions enables you to check if the stopper is present and whether it is fitted properly for the following process step.Depending on the contents and the production process, a container should either be completely sealed and the stopper fully inserted, as is usually the case at the end of a filling process, or the closure has to remain permeable and the stopper only inserted halfway, for example, as is necessary for lyophilization. Your benefits Easy integration Whether in a cleanroom or under an isolator, our inspection system is suitable for every filling line. It is gas-tight, VHP-proof, and optimized for laminar flow Low maintenance A closed housing protects it securely against moisture, dust, and incorrect operation Crimp/cap inspection: securely closed and sealed With the crimp cap inspection from our Seidenader Solutions, you check the crimp and cap of vials for cosmetic and functional defects.Correct capping and crimping of pharmaceutical containers is critical to the safety and quality of the product. That’s because closures often also are used for dosing or administering the product. By inspecting directly after crimping or cap placement, you ensure that defects such as dents, scratches or damaged seals as well as inaccurate positioning, wrong color or the absence of the flip-off cap are already detected during production, thus enabling you to quickly eliminate possible faults within the process. Your benefits Easy integration Whether in a cleanroom or under an isolator, our inspection system is suitable for any filling line. It is gas-tight, VHP-proof, and optimized for laminar flow Low maintenance Safely protected against moisture, dust and operating errors by a closed housing Inspection technologies: Everything that you need We have the right solution for every container, every product, and every requirement.Explore our solutions Automatic inspection Our machines combine optimally adapted handling, precise image processing and innovative inspection technologies for maximum efficiency.

Check samples from your production visually on a handy tabletop unit directly on the production line or under production conditions conveniently in the laboratory. Or test various parameters of your automatic inspection in advance on a fully equipped inspection unit smaller than on one square meter – without interrupting your ongoing production. For the manual inspection of your products, we offer you ergonomic support as a handy tabletop unit or height-adjustable inspection booth, designed in accordance with USP1790. Lab unit EVE Tabletop unit VPE manual inspection MVIC EVE: Optimize your inspection parameters offline Our mobile and flexible lab unit EVE provides you with the settings of up to 14 camera stations for the simulation of your production environment. Gain data and insights to optimize your existing process and products or develop new ones.Lab tests under industrial conditions: EVE enables you to simulate all of the inspection parameters of our fully automatic inspection machines on an extremely small footprint. Thanks to a turret for four different camera lenses as well as adjustable camera angles, you only need two stations to depict 14 camera stations of an automatic inspection machine — without interrupting the ongoing production process.And EVE can do lots more. In fact, the platform’s claim is: “Turn seeing into knowing.” That’s because all data and images of product features and defect properties collected during test runs are stored and are available for analyses as well as for customized reports and documentation. This enables you to compare results and interpret them more easily. In case of increased reject rates of your fully automated machine, our lab unit can also augment the images of defects in order to further increase the precision of our AI-based deep-learning software Eject-X. Thus you permanently build up knowledge that helps you optimize existing products and processes and develop new ones.We require your consentThis video is hosted by YouTube, provided by Google LLC (US).

The tabletop unit offers you adjustable backlighting, a continuously adjustable rotation, format parts for all container types that are run on your production line, as well as a polarizing filter and a magnifying glass. This allows you to check your samples, identify the causes of faults directly at the outfeed of your inspection machine, and eliminate them .The VPE also helps you select samples and examine particle defects for the Knapp test.

Or use it for secondary inspection and as a backup for your semi or fully automatic inspection machines. In addition to all container types inspected on our high-performance machines, you can also manually inspect large containers such as bottles or IV bags in the MVIC.The TTV (table top vision) as a portable tabletop version offers you similar functions in a very small space.Flyer: MVICManual inspection: Our user friendly platform MVIC facilitates all manual inspection applications in the pharmaceutical market - in accordance with USP1790 Download Semi-automatic inspection Our V90+ complements your visual inspection perfectly: flexible, ergonomic, and intuitive to operate.Explore our solutions Automatic inspection Our machines combine proven technology, precise image processing and innovative inspection technologies for maximum efficiency.

We supply international pharmaceutical customers with packaging that is made solely of paper fibers that are also biodegradable.

Körber’s Patient Support App tells patients how to use medications correctly, reminds them when they should take their medicine, and automatically reorders medications. When combined with smart packaging, the app gives your patients access to various augmented reality functions. Users can download the Patient Support App onto smartphones and wearables, and it can help patients to greatly improve the success of their treatments. It’s also a valuable marketing and measurement tool for manufacturers. The functions of the Patient Support App Instructional videos Images are often easier to understand than texts or explanations provided by experts. That’s why the app can also incorporate videos that show users how to use the medications or syringes correctly. Looking inside the packaging The app provides users with a virtual look inside the packaging. As a result, pharmacists don’t have to open the packaging to present the contents and explain to patients how to use them correctly. Digital package insert with a read-aloud function Patients no longer have to tediously decipher densely printed package inserts. The Patient Support App enables users to read all of the key information on their smartphones or have it read aloud to them via the “Text to Speech” function. Improving compliance Never forget to take your medication again: A reminder function makes it easier for patients to comply with their personalized medication schedule. This increases compliance and thus improves the chances of recovery. Moreover, it makes it possible to gain meaningful results from clinical trials. Easy management of patient data Thanks to the app, information that is important for a patient’s treatment doesn’t have to be re-entered again and again. The app enables users to conveniently store and manage all of the relevant data and also make it available to pharmacists. Automatic reordering of medications at the preferred pharmacy The Patient Support App helps chronically ill patients to reorder their medications. The app automatically sends an e-mail to reorder medicines on time and does so at the patient’s previously registered preferred pharmacy.Patients support appGreater safety for patients and pharmacists Download How the Patient Support App works We require your consentThis video is hosted by YouTube, provided by Google LLC (US).

In the development, implementation and qualification of pharma-compliant secondary packaging, in addition to precision and maximum product protection, smooth integration of the packaging solution into production processes and a fast time-to-market are also important. With its Packaging Qualification Services, Körber enables its pharma customers to examine the optimal product protection of their secondary packaging using recognized pre-tests during the qualification phase. This means that product launches can be accelerated and additional costs due to checks can be avoided.In recent years, Körber AG’s Pharma Packaging Materials Business Area has continued to broaden its expertise in the area of packaging development at its locations in Europe and the USA. Since mid-2021, Körber packaging specialists have been offering their pharma customers, at the locations in Allschwil in Switzerland, in Ejpovice in the Czech Republic and in Camden, NJ, USA, the opportunity to develop their secondary packaging in accordance with uniform standards in ‘Packaging Innovation Centers’. One particular offering is Packaging Qualification Services.0„With our Packaging Qualification Services, we can give our customers the opportunity to quickly and flexibly test a wide range of properties and behaviors of their folding boxes and to draw valuable conclusions for the optimization of their packaging,“ explains Patric Buck, Head of Innovation Packaging Materials in Körber‘s Pharma Business Area. „This saves them the sometimes very time-consuming search for available external testing laboratories.“ Körber offers this service regardless of whether the folding boxes have been developed in-house or by another provider.Among other things, the Packaging Qualification Services offered by the packaging experts include tests on the resilience of the packaging and on product protection during production and shipping. By simulating the packaging free-falling onto its corners, edges and surfaces from a defined height, pharma companies can demonstrate that the packaging is intact after the drop and that the product is not damaged. Tensile and compression tests are carried out to prove that adhesive bonds can withstand defined tensile and compressive forces and that perforations tear cleanly and in a clearly defined manner. In addition, the forces required to open the packaging or perforation can be tested. Abrasion tests are carried to test the resistance of cardboard surfaces to mechanical stress, liquids and lubricants.A climate simulation can also be used to test the behavior of folding boxes under specific environmental conditions. At temperatures of -75 °C to 180 °C and a relative humidity of 10% to 98%, extreme transport and storage temperatures, for example of Covid-19 vaccines or in tropical regions, can be simulated, as well as the aging of a product over its life cycle. Tests such as resistance to creasing, friction coefficient and erecting force provide information on the machinability of folding cartons on high-performance packaging machines. The resistance between the individual cardboard blanks, the coefficient of friction, has an effect on the smooth feeding of the folding box blanks into the system. In addition, the creasing resistance defines the force required to fold the blanks and to bend and flip the tabs. These tests can therefore ensure that blanks from different suppliers are also reliably suitable for use in the machines, without time-consuming adjustment of system parameters.For more information about Packaging Qualification Services:https://www.koerber-pharma.com/services/packaging-qualification-services Contact Tom Egli Körber Pharma Packaging Materials AG Marketing Manager tom.egli@koerber.com Related files Download photos Download ZIP file (3 MB)Download news Download PDF file (774 KB) Share this article Back to top Imprint Disclaimer Privacy Policy Purchasing Conditions Compliance and Code of Conduct EnglishDeutschEnglish中文日本© 2023 Körber AG.

New printing, gluing and labeling machines will be installed in Allschwil in Switzerland, Ejpovice in the Czech Republic and Camden in the USA by the beginning of 2022. They are intended to meet the increasing demand from the pharmaceutical industry for high-quality secondary packaging from Rondo Solutions in the future.New high-performance Heidelberg Speedmaster XL printing presses are being installed at three Körber sites. ""The latest machine technology is crucial for even faster, more flexible and more productive folding-box production. It enables us to shorten set-up times, reduce waste, and offer even more product variety,"" explains Joachim Hoeltz, Packaging Materials Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Körber Business Area Pharma. Intelligent support systems relieve employees of many routine tasks and assist with machine operation. ""This allows us to increasingly call up the maximum output of 18,000 sheets per hour and further reduce set-up times for orders,"" says Giovanni De Luca, Head of Production at Körber’s Swiss site. In addition, thanks to the eight or ten printing units, the systems also meet special customer requirements such as printing with many spot colors, combining different grades and country variants, and inline reverse-side printing.The challenges facing the industry are immense: ""Expiring patents are increasing the cost pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers. At the same time, the trend towards personalized medicine is causing batch sizes to shrink and packaging variety to increase. Very large pharmaceutical manufacturers in particular are therefore producing less and less on stock,"" says Joachim Hoeltz. Körber’s packaging experts responded to these developments at an early stage with product innovation, digitalization and process automation. The supply-on-demand service for short runs, for example, enables very short delivery times of two to five days, for order sizes of 100 to 5,000 sheets. lAt the same time, the trend towards personalized medicine is causing batch sizes to shrink and packaging variety to increase.rJoachim Hoeltz, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Packaging Materials Körber Business Area PharmaIn addition to expanding its printing capacity, Körber is also expanding its processing capacities at the Swiss site. A labeling machine and a folding carton gluing machine from Bobst designed for versatility and one hundred percent camera inspection will support Körber's pharmaceutical customers in their desire for more packaging functionality and further accommodate the trend towards zero-defect production.All machines at the various locations are almost identical in design and equipped for mixed operation. ""This means, we can meet special requirements of international customers worldwide uniformly from all locations at short notice,"" explains Joachim Hoeltz. For the packaging specialists at Körber, one thing is certain: the current investments contribute to being able to deliver at any time whilst at the same time meeting the extraordinarily high demands of customers for quality and product safety. Hoeltz is also convinced: “With state-of-the-art equipment, we are strengthening the attractiveness of our locations for qualified, committed employees."" The interplay of know-how, technologies and processes on which Körber is relying will ensure the competitiveness and security of supply of pharmaceutical customers in the future and make the decisive difference for them.

But how do you identify quick wins?At Körber, there are two ways we support you in implementing a digital strategy required by your own management, customers, pressure from competitors, or government authorities: First, we assess your digital maturity level using a manufacturer-independent scoring model to determine exactly where you stand. Second, we assist you as an experienced long-term partner in defining (or adjusting) your digital transformation roadmap and guide you in executing only the components of Pharma 4.0 that really deliver measurable added value when it comes to ROI. Find out your digital maturity levelBeing aware of your digital maturity levellWe now know exactly where we are in terms of digital maturity. Together with Körber’s consulting experts, we will tackle and master the next steps.rDr. Thomas Koy, Executive Director Technical Operations, Develco Pharma GmbH Find out your digital maturity level Being aware of your digital maturity level Implementing digitization requires a detailed review of the current situation to determine exactly where you stand as a company. The manufacturer-independent framework of BioPhorum, a global industry collaboration accelerating progress within the biopharmaceutical industry, delivers exactly that with its Digital Plant Maturity Model. The model aims to address questions that were previously difficult to answer, such as ""How mature is my plant today? and ""What are my aspirations for transformation over the next three, five and 10 years?"" Your benefits Precise score The digital maturity assessment checks up to 186 test points in 8 relevant dimensions for Pharma 4.0 such as ""people & culture"" and ""production planning & supply chain"". Industry benchmarking You will find out how digital plant capabilities can be defined, measured, and transformed and how your plants compare against industry benchmarks. Identify prerequisites The model will pinpoint any requirements that are keeping your company from moving up the digital maturity curve, e.g., replacing paper-based documentation with Electronic Batch Records management. Get started fast We can assess your digital maturity within ten working days. After only three hours you will exactly know where you stand – your starting point for successfully implementing digitization.Any questions? Contact us.Get in contactWhen you know where you stand in terms of digitization, it is important to peek behind the ""Pharma 4.0"" label and distinguish what you really need from things that would be nice to have but are of negligible importance. You need to know your risks and challenges on the way of moving up the maturity curve. Rest assured that we support you to the degree you want to involve us. At Körber, we follow a hands-on approach, and we maintain long-term relationships. With our exclusive focus on pharma, we understand your processes and the challenges you face every day. Your benefits No buzzwords Pharma 4.0 is associated with many other phrases. Being state-of-the-art requires major investments. We will help you to tell the difference between what you really need and what’s optional. Focus on ROI Together we will overcome your challenges and identify the projects which promise real added value for you and deserve inclusion in your budget. Recommendations for action One step after the other: In close coordination with you we will develop specific prioritized actions to define your digital transformation roadmap – or adjust an existing one. Long-term full service We would be happy to support you in executing your digital strategy if you wish – that's why 97% of our clients decide to stay with us following the initial project. Any questions? Contact us.Get in contactExpand allCollapse all Foundation package This package will assess your digital maturity level and identify the most critical digital pain points.

It’s no longer sufficient for companies to keep track of stock counts — a Warehouse Management System (WMS) now has to be adapted to every new regulation.Are you looking for a WMS that can be quickly and flexibly adapted to handle new requirements? That’s exactly what we’re offering with “STEPLogic.” Our WMS can be personalized and customized to meet your specific needs in next to no time. It’s particularly suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises, which STEPLogic enables to work at all times in an agile and cost-effective way. STEPLogic TRACE STEPLogic TRACE FMD STEPLogic TRACE is the glue between your Warehouse Management System (WMS) and the serialization repository. It enables you to handle serialized products with your existing WMS without facing high implementation costs. You only scan once and then distribute the information to the serialization repository and the WMS.Within the EU, all manufacturers holding a marketing authorization have to upload master and transactional data into the national systems via the European Hub. STEPLogic TRACE FMD ensures that you, as a wholesaler, conform with the European Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD). And even better, the tremendously powerful STEPLogic platform can be extended with various other functions as required — including a complete Warehouse Management System.

Our digitization experts provide you with answers to these groundbreaking questions.Our consulting team accompanies you from the initial idea through to your own digitization strategy, works with you on its customized implementation, and afterward remains at your side to offer advice.Thanks to our many years of pharmaceutical expertise, we work with you to develop modern approaches that can be implemented following regulatory guidelines in the GMP environment. One example of this is our projects with augmented reality support: Quality-relevant changeover processes become simple and secure thanks to Line Optimizer - Execute. Line optimizations can be achieved with Line Optimizer - Manage.lA guided workflow project utilizing augmented reality provides a reliable entry into paperless production.rMichael Völlinger, Business Director Consulting Pharma 4.0: Augmented reality facilitates workflows. Guided workflows with Line Optimizer - Execute In conventional setups, operators must be trained for each machine they are supposed to work on. With Line Optimizer - Execute, your employees are trained using a technique instead of a machine. As a result, the team can carry out its tasks without overlaps.Workflows such as format changing or line clearance are carried out in parallel and passed on to the next operators without problems, for example, when a shift change occurs. The user guidance prevents any process steps from being inadvertently left out. This avoids errors, leading to an increase of up to 30% in machine availability. What’s more, it also reduces familiarization times, lowers training costs and the use of resources. Line-Optimizations with Line Optimizer - Manage Your operators can control the entire line with just one HMI, regardless of the machine he or she isthey are on. This eliminates the need to train them on the different, machine-specific HMIs. The OEE key performance indicators can also be called up at any time through Line Optimizer - Manage. All data including stop reasons are available to derive further measures for OEE improvements. Line Optimizer - Manage can even take care of data transfer to MES solutions or other local data systems for you, if you wish.

Regardless of whether the folding box was developed by us or externally. These tests are carried out in accordance with the applicable ASTM, DIN or ISO standards. The involvement of a third-party test laboratory is not required.Drop testThe drop test simulates the free fall of a package onto corners, edges and surfaces from a defined height according to DIN 22248, DIN ISO 2248, DIN EN 22206, DIN EN 24180 and ASTM 7386. It demonstrates the intactness of the package and proves that the product is not damaged.

Using accelerated ageing, for example, we can simulate within five months what the product will look like after three years of ageing.Tensile and pressure testAmong other things, adhesive joints and the perforation of packaging can be checked with the use of a Zwick testing machine.Abrasion testThis procedure controls the resistance of carton surfaces to mechanical stress and liquids.The so-called Sutherland-Rub-Test follows the guidelines ASTM D5264 / TAPPI T83.Erecting forceThe erecting force measures the maximum force required to erect a flat, pre-glued folding box along its creasing lines.Creasing resistanceThe maximum force required to fold or flip a flap (surface) by 90°.is defined by the Score Bend Test.Friction coefficientThe calculated coefficient of friction (COF) provides information about the resistance between the individual carton blanks when they are fed into the packaging machine.

In doing so, we always act as a central point of contact for you, thus reducing not only the complexity of your daily routine but also the number of external service providers for your business. Contact us Your path to digital production IT & DigitalizationA faster market maturity of products, growing and complex regulatory requirements in production, and an increasing need for data availability for production optimization are just some of the challenges of global digitization. As digital experts for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, we keep track of things for you and help you with this technology transfer. Whether individual AI-supported and modular software solutions or holistic cloud-based data management strategies and systems with a high degree of maturity, we identify trends and implement the latest technologies in your factory of excellence. This also includes the possibility of carrying out your production processes in a secure and independent manner. As a strategic partner, we help you implement autonomous production processes that can extend all the way to a dark factory. In this way we further increase your overall equipment efficiency, minimize system downtime, and permanently reduce your production costs. Ensuring process quality to comply with regulatory requirements Quality & ComplianceExceptional quality within production is an essential constant in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. However, regulatory requirements often pose a complex challenge and have a significant influence on the qualification and validation process. Thanks to our many years of industry expertise and constant communication with regulatory authorities, we can help implement stable processes with individual analysis and tailored consulting. To do this, we look at all the system interfaces of your production system, offer you robust validation protocols for artificial intelligence, and enable seamless traceability along the production chain of your factory of excellence — secure, completely paperless, and based on the latest technologies. Exceptional quality within production is an essential constant in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. However, regulatory requirements often pose a complex challenge and have a significant influence on the qualification and validation process.

The one stop shop taking the pain out of your production ProductionMore efficient and more networked production processes are guiding principles of Industry 4.0 as well as concrete requirements for the future pharmaceutical and biotech industries. At the same time, demand for smaller and more flexible production facilities is increasing in the face of growing regulatory requirements and rising cost pressures. These complex challenges make it difficult to focus on your core business and require new business models such as pay-per-pack or pay-per-use for a demand-driven approach. As a one-stop-shop provider, we take this complexity off your hands. Together, we determine your specific needs and offer you scalable solutions certified to the highest industry standards for your factory of excellence, including setup and qualification services. We integrate the skill sets of our extensive partner network and offer holistic line concepts from a single source to significantly shorten your products’ time to market. Optimize running production and maximize your OEE Operational ExcellenceThe path to maximum performance of your production often depends on many different factors. Individual production tasks such as longer changeover times or above-average number of rejects due to processes that are not optimally coordinated quickly lead to significant performance losses and negative overall equipment effectiveness. Our experts will be at your side to reduce such downtimes. We advise you in advance on the optimal process visualizations and improvement potentials of a production line, train your machine operators accordingly, and create a maintenance plan that enables you to prepare all maintenance periods in advance. Should a problem arise, our service technicians will assist you worldwide — both remotely and directly at your side. Together, we achieve significantly higher efficiency over the entire service life of a production line. Integrated end-to-end supply chain solutions from one source Supply ChainA stable and high-performance supply chain is the basic prerequisite for reliable production. It guarantees the prevention of material bottlenecks and a more efficient use of raw materials. It can be used to build a sustainable circular economy that minimizes waste and conserves resources. Our integrated end-to-end supply chain helps to optimally manage material requirements. Seamless dovetailing allows better integration of software and hardware, resulting in greater automation and efficiency, cost savings, and increased delivery speed. This holistic view enables us to accurately simulate the flow of materials and better understand and plan the effects of changes from the outset. This planning capability allows you to release working capital from inventory and use it more effectively. Even better together Partner networkHaving different service providers within a production chain often leads to complex processes. The reasons for this are different machine interfaces, individual solutions instead of holistic line concepts, and an increased need for communication and coordination. As experts for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, we therefore offer you holistic solutions from a single source. To this end, we work with you and our innovative partner network to develop line and interface concepts that are tailored specifically to your needs. Through open collaboration, we create seamless integration of third-party systems, find quick solutions to emerging challenges, and enable you to be more productive. With us as your central point of contact, you benefit from our third-party service, which enables you to take advantage of additional services without having to contact another provider.

The recyclable cardboard COVID-19 rapid antigen test from the international technology group Körber has been awarded the prestigious Sustainability Initiative award at Pharmapack 2023, one of the leading industry events taking place in Paris. This is the second time in a row for Körber, having received the same award at last year’s event for its sustainable grass paper packaging solutions.With the spread of COVID-19 around the world, rapid antigen tests became equally ubiquitous. Huge numbers of tests were produced out of plastic in short order, and now it’s impossible to imagine life without them. In 2021, over 113 million test kits were used in Germany alone – resulting in 678 metric tons of plastic waste.This is where the Swiss packaging experts from Körber Group’s Business Area Pharma come in: they’ve developed packaging for COVID-19 tests that replaces 100 percent of the plastic components with cardboard monomaterial. This solution offers enormous benefits for the environment: Today, some 80 percent of plastic waste is incinerated, leading to high CO₂ emissions. In comparison, 80 percent of the Körber cardboard packaging can be recycled—and this up to twenty times. Furthermore, the use of monomaterial means that CO₂ emissions from manufacturing the packaging are reduced by more than 50 percent. And lastly, the packaging’s raw materials are 30 percent lighter, reducing transport weight.“Our latest solution is not just a change in material. It also has an extraordinarily positive effect on our environment by saving tons of CO₂. For us, the important thing about this is being able to provide a huge added value not only to our customers, but also to our society,” said Joachim Hoeltz, CEO at Körber Pharma Packaging Materials AG, at the presentation of the Sustainability Initiative Award in Paris. He added that “sustainability is not just a buzzword for us, but an important goal we’ve been pursuing for decades already. Being honored with this year’s Pharmapack Sustainability Initiative Award, after having also received it in 2022, means we’re on the right track.”Functional and sustainable while saving costsWith Körber’s customized packaging solutions, functionality and sustainability are not the only benefits. The experts at Körber are also dedicated to enhancing cost efficiency. This was recognized just recently in December 2022 when Körber’s “FlexPack” solution, which allows vials and ampoules of different sizes to be integrated within the same package, was a Gold Winner in the “Cost-Effective” category at the InnoPack Awards in China. “FlexPack” offers the pharma industry huge economic advantages, especially when it comes to highly sensitive biopharmaceuticals.About Körber’s Business Area PharmaAt the Körber Business Area Pharma we are delivering the difference along the pharma value chain with our unique portfolio of integrated solutions.

This applies in all of the countries in which we are active. Adherence to external and internal rules is obligatory for all those who work in the Körber Group. We have laid this approach down in our Code of Conduct for Managers and Employees.Corporate GovernanceKörber AG is not stockmarket listed. The sole shareholder is the Körber Foundation. Because the company is based in Germany, our Corporate Governance is subject to German law. This concerns in particular the three corporate bodies: shareholders’ meeting, Executive Board and Supervisory Board, as well as their reciprocal relationships.The Corporate Governance of the Körber Group ensures responsible, transparent management which focuses on long-term success. This is in the interest of the company, its shareholder, its employees as well as external stakeholders.Risk managementWithin the framework of their global activities, the companies of the Körber Group are exposed to a wide variety of risks. These are an inevitable part of any corporate activity. In order to identify, evaluate and rigorously tackle these risks from an early stage, the Körber Group has set up a group-wide risk management system.SustainabilityThe Körber Group has from the outset pursued a strategy of sustainability. As the sole shareholder of Körber AG, the Körber Foundation also supports this sustainable development, and safeguards the financial independence of the Körber Group.However, our understanding of sustainability goes further. Our strategy aims to bring economic, ecological and social objectives into line with each other.Economic responsibilityOur guiding principle is to finance our growth exclusively from our own resources. By this means we secure our financial independence and create the foundation for sustained positive development. Our goal is to create values and to boost the value of the company.Long-term positive development is more important to us than short-time success. This also applies to our expenditure on research and development, which is consistently above the sector average, as well as to the high levels of investment and the development of new business fields.Ecological responsibilityEnvironmental protection is one of the central objectives of the Körber Group. This is not distinct from other goals, but is instead an integral component of the long-term corporate strategy. An inherent part of the striving for the highest-possible product quality is the efficient use of resources. This applies not just to our production processes, but also to our products. The aim of our environmental policy is to strike a balance between environmental protection and business efficiency.Social responsibilityOur economic actions are based upon social principles which we have undertaken to exercise vis-à-vis our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. We are keen to ensure that the capital at our disposal is deployed in such a manner that we are able to offer our employees interesting and secure places of work. Of particular interest to us in this conjunction is our determination to provide young people with training, thus giving them a good start to their professional careers. The protection of human rights, safeguarding the future, health protection, further training, industrial safety and the encouragement of diversity within our company are important issues when it comes to promoting our sustainability.Reporting of compliance violationsOur behavior must at all times correspond to our Fundamentals and Corporate Values, legal regulations as well as social norms.
