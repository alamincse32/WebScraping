We believe that honesty, integrity, respect and fairness foster our relationships to ensure sustainable operations. For multiple generations, SB&B has been connecting the global marketplace with the farmer’s food production. SB&B does not speculate the food market, we only contract what we sell.Expanding across the upper Midwest, we deliver a diverse genetic lineup that will handle many soil types, disease pressures and maturity ranges. We strive in the opportunity to place the right genetics that fits your ground profile to ensure maximum profitability. We capitalize on providing farmers an opportunity to understand where their food production is going and get paid fairly for the quality they produce JOIN THE FOOD-GRADE MOVEMENTYear after year, you head into spring with the same rotation: planting corn and soybeans. But what if there was a way to diversify and turn a larger profit, while continuing to do what you know and love? It may be time to consider adding food-grade soybeans into your operation. Food-grade soybeans are specific varieties selected for characteristics ideal for the production of tofu, natto, soy milk, and other soy foods.Here are 3 reasons why you should consider joining us in the food-grade movement:1. IDENTITY PRESERVATIONSB&B works hard to maintain top-notch traceability methods that allow their growers to pinpoint each step in the supply process, further increasing the value of the product.2. PREMIUMThe premium payments for food-grade soybeans is a direct reflection of the demand for these unique varieties. Consumers are willing to pay a higher price for enhanced-quality soybeans, and soybean handlers are willing to pass that along to the farmers.3. PRIDEFood grade soybeans are a high-end quality crop and that alone is pride worthy. When it comes to marketing soybeans, there are numerous opportunities available, but none quite like knowing your product is making an actual difference in someone’s life - and on their dinner plate. SB&B offers contracts that work within your current business operation and is fully invested in bringing your food-grade soybeans to market.
