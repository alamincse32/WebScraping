Our first roll-forming machine was a K-style Ogee gutter machine that is still running and producing gutters today! The fascia gutter machines we produce now maintain the integrity and longevity of this original design, with a few engineering updates made over the years to enhance performance. This ensures a constant design that gives you a completely field-tested machine that is dependable under all conditions. After Eastside Machine Co. revolutionized the gutter machine industry, it was time to tackle the siding industry. We were the first to manufacture a portable embossing seamless siding machine for jobsite use, which rolled off our assembly line in 1971! Although the basic engineering concept remains the same today, we continue to incorporate changes and make enhancements for optimal performance, durability, and productivity. Our current EM 6/8/10 Combo Siding Machine sets the standard in the United States as a true profit partner. Today we continue to dominate the roll-forming industry with our snap lock roofing machine for residential and light commercial use, as well as our custom machines designed to fit your specific needs. We are constantly innovating to enhance our offering to our customers. Plus, Eastside Machine Co. not only builds the toughest roll-formers on the market today, but we also offer both steel and aluminum siding, gutter, and roofing coil and accessories through our affiliate, EMCO Building Products. We are your one-stop seamless roll-forming company.

Our patented design (patent design USD#462,790) gives the exterior look of real wood logs, made of steel. This profile looks impressive on large homes that want to look of a log cabin and fantastic in most commercial applications. It is important to be aware that this profile does require a custom foam backer that not only supports the profile, but also gives added r-value. Portability, durability, and product flexibility are just three of the many compelling reasons to choose an Eastside Machine Company built seamless siding portable roll-former. To be successful in the siding industry you need to be productive with your assets. Down time costs you money!

EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machine Guillotine Cutter 6 Adjustable Run-Out Stands 10 Run-Out Rails Coil Cradle with 3 Spools (Machine Can Hold up to 4 Spools – Not Recommended to Drive with 4) 1 Spool Brake Owner's Manual The Eastside Machine Company EM 8 Log jobsite roll-formers are built upon a heavy-duty steel frame for structural stability and forming consistency. Industrial nitrocarburized (QPQ) steel rollers are used in all machines from Eastside Machine Co. Nitrocarburizing rollers allow for improved wear, lubricity, strength, and corrosion resistance. Our proprietary embossing rollers, which apply an authentic and natural woodgrain texture to steel or aluminum coil, are artfully designed for pattern beauty and panel rigidity. An extendable cutting table gives you the flexibility to make your cuts more precise. Our portable seamless siding machines operate with a 1.5 HP, 115 Volt, 20 Amp electric motor and have variable speed frequency drive. This allows our seamless siding machines an infinitely adjustable forming speed from 1' to 60', giving you the ability to produce more than other machines on the market. Our siding machines also come standard with an extendable remote switch with forward and reverse, allowing machine operation from outside the trailer. Eastside Machine Co. knows the importance of making loading and unloading coils as simple and safe as possible. With siding machines from Eastside Machine Co., your installers/operators can load and unload coils without using a forklift, like most portable seamless siding machines. An accessory coil loading system can be mounted to your enclosed siding trailer and can effortlessly lift coils up to 2,500# in a matter of minutes using a 110 Volt winch. Safety is very important at Eastside Machine Co., and it is something we take very seriously. All our seamless siding machines are equipped with an emergency shut-off button and a spool brake to control the coil when operating the machine. Like all machines from Eastside Machine Co., our portable seamless siding machines come with operational training, technical support, and a five-year warranty. Machine Specifications (as shown) Machine Dimensions: 138"" (L) x 33.5"" (W) x 45"" (Height with Spools) Machine Weight: 2,975# (1,980# Machine Plus Coil Cradle and 3 Spools) Coil Widths: 10 5/8"" (Other Options Available Upon Request) Materials: Steel: 28–29 Gauge Number of Forming Stations: 9 Main Forming Stations Operational speed: Variable to 60 ft/min Shear/Cutter: Side Pull Guillotine Power: 1.5 HP, 110 Volt, Single Phase, 20 Amps Controls: Push Button Tethered Remote Control with 10' Cord Safety: Emergency Shut-off Switch at Entry End Warranty: Five-Year Limited Warranty Misc: Weep Hole and Nail Slot Punches Standard Profiles & Insulation Backer The attractive log siding profile is exclusive to the EM 8 Log jobsite roll-former. This unique profile was designed to give the appearance of a log cabin exterior for both residential and commercial applications. We recommend using a custom contoured foam backer engineered specifically for the EM 8 Log profile. This precisely contoured foam underlayment adds rigidity and superior impact resistance. It is available to order as needed. To learn more about the benefits and importance of the custom foam backer, call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834. Guillotine Cutter Eastside Machine Co. offers a multi-profile guillotine cutter standard on every seamless siding machine. Industrial nitrocarburized steel blade gives a very desirable, clean cut. The durability of the blade allows it to keep its sharp cutting edge, which minimizes maintenance; think of an Eastside Machine Co. guillotine cutter as comparable to the Ginsu knife's role in a kitchen. Unidrive System Unidrive is an AC Drive and Controller system with integrated Programmable Logic Control (PLC), and comes standard on all 2016 and newer EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machines. The Unidrive converts single phase 110 Volt to 3-phase 220 Volt without the need of a transformer, resulting in a much more efficient use of power. Unidrive benefits include: less power used, fewer circuit breaker, and GFI outlet problems and the ability to add the ATM system to your Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine. All seamless siding machines come equipped with Unidrive. Benefits include more power efficiency, fewer tripped Circuit Breaker, no transformer, and the ability to add Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System. Have an older Eastside Machine Co. EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machine with Softstart or Phase II Electrical? Unidrive can easily be added to 2015 and earlier models. Just call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834 to learn more. Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System (Optional) The Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System will measure the panel length as it is formed. Cut lengths can be set in the ATM without the need of measuring. Batch any number of same-length panels to increase efficiency, all while adding convenience and accuracy on the jobsite. ATM is also a great way to track the total number of feet used (like an odometer in a car) or the number of feet used during a single job. ATM is an upgrade that can be added to any Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine with the Unidrive system. To learn more about the benefits of ATM and how it can help your install teams be safer and more efficient both in accuracy and speed, call customer service at (800) 234-7834.

Industrial nitro-carburized (QPQ) steel rollers are used in all Eastside Machine Co. products. Nitrocarburizing rollers allow for improved wear and lubricity, as well as strength and corrosion resistance. Our proprietary embossing rollers, which apply an authentic and natural woodgrain texture to steel or aluminum coil, are artfully designed for pattern beauty and panel rigidity. An extendable cutting table gives you the flexibility to make your cuts more precise. Our portable siding machines operate with a 1.5 HP, 115 Volt, 20 Amp electric motor and have variable speed frequency drive. This allows our seamless siding machines an infinitely adjustable forming speed from 1' to 60', giving you the ability to produce more than other machines on the market. Our siding machines also come standard with an extendable remote switch with forward and reverse, allowing machine operation from outside the trailer. Eastside Machine Co. knows the importance of making loading and unloading coils as simple and safe as possible. With siding machines from Eastside Machine Co., your installers/operators can load and unload coils without using a forklift, like most portable siding machines. An accessory coil loading system can be mounted to your enclosed siding trailer and can effortlessly lift coils up to 2,500# in a matter of minutes using a 110 Volt winch. Safety is very important at Eastside Machine Co., and it is something we take very seriously. All our siding machines are equipped with an emergency shut-off button and a spool brake to control the coil when operating the machine. Like all machines from Eastside Machine Co., our portable seamless siding machines come with operational training, technical support, and a five-year warranty.

Industrial nitrocarburized steel blade gives a very desirable, clean cut. The durability of the blade allows it to keep its sharp cutting edge, which minimizes maintenance; think of an Eastside Machine Co. guillotine cutter as comparable to the Ginsu knife's role in a kitchen. Unidrive System Unidrive is an AC Drive and Controller system with integrated Programmable Logic Control (PLC), and comes standard on all 2016 and newer EM 6/8/10 Combo Seamless Siding Machines. The Unidrive converts single phase 110 Volt to 3-phase 220 Volt without the need of a transformer, resulting in a much more efficient use of power. Unidrive benefits include: less power used, fewer circuit breaker, and GFI outlet problems and the ability to add the ATM system to your Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine. All siding machines come equipped with Unidrive. Benefits include more power efficiency, fewer tripped Circuit Breaker, no transformer, and the ability to add Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System. Have an older Eastside Machine Co. EM 6/8/10 Combo Seamless Siding Machine with Softstart or Phase II Electrical? Unidrive can easily be added to 2015 and earlier models. Just call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834 to learn more. Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System (Optional) The Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System will measure the panel length as it is formed. Cut lengths can be set in the ATM without the need of measuring. Batch any number of same-length panels to increase efficiency, all while adding convenience and accuracy on the jobsite. ATM is also a great way to track the total number of feet used (like an odometer in a car) or the number of feet used during a single job. ATM is an upgrade that can be added to any Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine with the Unidrive system. To learn more about the benefits of ATM and how it can help your install teams be safer and more efficient both in accuracy and speed, call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834.

Request More Info PDF Brochure Print This Machine Machine Overview Standard Equipment Package Machine Details Dealer & Rental Programs EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machines The portable EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machines are robust and the profile is extremely realistic. This user-friendly machine is designed, engineered and made in the USA. The patented roll-forming profile is unique and looks great on the wall. Eastside Machine Company's siding machines feature our original self-contained embossing system, which applies a natural woodgrain texture to steel coil. 8"" seamless steel log siding profile Heavy-duty steel frame for structural stability and forming consistency Variable speed frequency drive Weep hole and nail slot punches Patented design (USD# 462,790) Extendable cutting table Industrial hard-chrome-plated rollers Chrome-plated shafts Emergency shut-off Extendable push button control with tethered remote control and 10' cord The EM 8 Log jobsite roll-former is a smart add for those looking to expand within the siding industry whether purchasing or renting the portable log machine. With the maintenance concerns and upkeep of conventional real wood log siding, it is no surprise that a metal alternative is a big hit. Our patented design (patent design USD#462,790) gives the exterior look of real wood logs, made of steel. This profile looks impressive on large homes that want to look of a log cabin and fantastic in most commercial applications. It is important to be aware that this profile does require a custom foam backer that not only supports the profile, but also gives added r-value. Portability, durability, and product flexibility are just three of the many compelling reasons to choose an Eastside Machine Company built seamless siding portable roll-former. To be successful in the siding industry you need to be productive with your assets. Down time costs you money! With Eastside Machine Co.'s portable roll-formers, you’ll have peace of mind knowing that you bought an American-made and engineered roll-former that will make you more money. Our team is experienced and ready to help you with any questions from machine support and use to installation. EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machine Guillotine Cutter 6 Adjustable Run-Out Stands 10 Run-Out Rails Coil Cradle with 3 Spools (Machine Can Hold up to 4 Spools – Not Recommended to Drive with 4) 1 Spool Brake Owner's Manual The Eastside Machine Company EM 8 Log jobsite roll-formers are built upon a heavy-duty steel frame for structural stability and forming consistency. Industrial nitrocarburized (QPQ) steel rollers are used in all machines from Eastside Machine Co. Nitrocarburizing rollers allow for improved wear, lubricity, strength, and corrosion resistance. Our proprietary embossing rollers, which apply an authentic and natural woodgrain texture to steel or aluminum coil, are artfully designed for pattern beauty and panel rigidity. An extendable cutting table gives you the flexibility to make your cuts more precise. Our portable seamless siding machines operate with a 1.5 HP, 115 Volt, 20 Amp electric motor and have variable speed frequency drive. This allows our seamless siding machines an infinitely adjustable forming speed from 1' to 60', giving you the ability to produce more than other machines on the market. Our siding machines also come standard with an extendable remote switch with forward and reverse, allowing machine operation from outside the trailer. Eastside Machine Co. knows the importance of making loading and unloading coils as simple and safe as possible. With siding machines from Eastside Machine Co., your installers/operators can load and unload coils without using a forklift, like most portable seamless siding machines. An accessory coil loading system can be mounted to your enclosed siding trailer and can effortlessly lift coils up to 2,500# in a matter of minutes using a 110 Volt winch. Safety is very important at Eastside Machine Co., and it is something we take very seriously. All our seamless siding machines are equipped with an emergency shut-off button and a spool brake to control the coil when operating the machine. Like all machines from Eastside Machine Co., our portable seamless siding machines come with operational training, technical support, and a five-year warranty. Machine Specifications (as shown) Machine Dimensions: 138"" (L) x 33.5"" (W) x 45"" (Height with Spools) Machine Weight: 2,975# (1,980# Machine Plus Coil Cradle and 3 Spools) Coil Widths: 10 5/8"" (Other Options Available Upon Request) Materials: Steel: 28–29 Gauge Number of Forming Stations: 9 Main Forming Stations Operational speed: Variable to 60 ft/min Shear/Cutter: Side Pull Guillotine Power: 1.5 HP, 110 Volt, Single Phase, 20 Amps Controls: Push Button Tethered Remote Control with 10' Cord Safety: Emergency Shut-off Switch at Entry End Warranty: Five-Year Limited Warranty Misc: Weep Hole and Nail Slot Punches Standard Profiles & Insulation Backer The attractive log siding profile is exclusive to the EM 8 Log jobsite roll-former. This unique profile was designed to give the appearance of a log cabin exterior for both residential and commercial applications. We recommend using a custom contoured foam backer engineered specifically for the EM 8 Log profile. This precisely contoured foam underlayment adds rigidity and superior impact resistance. It is available to order as needed. To learn more about the benefits and importance of the custom foam backer, call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834. Guillotine Cutter Eastside Machine Co. offers a multi-profile guillotine cutter standard on every seamless siding machine. Industrial nitrocarburized steel blade gives a very desirable, clean cut. The durability of the blade allows it to keep its sharp cutting edge, which minimizes maintenance; think of an Eastside Machine Co. guillotine cutter as comparable to the Ginsu knife's role in a kitchen. Unidrive System Unidrive is an AC Drive and Controller system with integrated Programmable Logic Control (PLC), and comes standard on all 2016 and newer EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machines. The Unidrive converts single phase 110 Volt to 3-phase 220 Volt without the need of a transformer, resulting in a much more efficient use of power. Unidrive benefits include: less power used, fewer circuit breaker, and GFI outlet problems and the ability to add the ATM system to your Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine. All seamless siding machines come equipped with Unidrive. Benefits include more power efficiency, fewer tripped Circuit Breaker, no transformer, and the ability to add Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System. Have an older Eastside Machine Co. EM 8 Log Seamless Siding Machine with Softstart or Phase II Electrical? Unidrive can easily be added to 2015 and earlier models. Just call Customer Service at (800) 234-7834 to learn more. Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System (Optional) The Auto Tape Measure (ATM) System will measure the panel length as it is formed. Cut lengths can be set in the ATM without the need of measuring. Batch any number of same-length panels to increase efficiency, all while adding convenience and accuracy on the jobsite. ATM is also a great way to track the total number of feet used (like an odometer in a car) or the number of feet used during a single job. ATM is an upgrade that can be added to any Eastside Machine Co. portable siding machine with the Unidrive system. To learn more about the benefits of ATM and how it can help your install teams be safer and more efficient both in accuracy and speed, call customer service at (800) 234-7834.
