He applied his unique skill-set to solving the problems that he faced as a truss-hauler and trucker himself. Since then, Precision Equipment has been manufacturing unique solutions for industry-leading truss-haulers. “…there was a quick learning curve that the rafters and wall panels were negatively impacted during the transport. As a result, custom built roller trailers with air ride suspension and specially designed braking systems to roll off the loads slowly and damage free at the jobsites were developed. The end users of the product could not have been happier! ” – Bob NelsonOur Story Precision Equipment Manufacturing started in 1999 when Bob Nelson purchased PEMNA, a Custom Fire Truck manufacturer. PEMNA built fire trucks for rural fire departments by taking used truck chassis’, building new tanks, and installing pumps with new technology that small departments could afford. As the market and economy changed these community fire departments got involved with government grants and charitable gambling, providing much greater means to purchase new trucks and equipment.It was time to retool. So using the name PEMNA as a basis, the name was changed to Precision Equipment Manufacturing of North America Inc. (PEMNA). During this transition, energy was diverted to custom fabricating of all sorts. Searching for a new product line, Snow Pro, a skid steer attachment for snow moving was developed. In the meantime, Precision Equipment also got involved with a rafter manufacturing company called United Structural Components. With a large customer base and urgent demand for finished product over 200 miles away, there was a quick learning curve that the rafters and wall panels were negatively impacted during the transport. As a result, custom built roller trailers with air ride suspension and specially designed braking systems to roll off the loads slowly and damage free at the jobsites were developed. The end users of the product could not have been happier! This concept took off rapidly, taking Precision Equipment into a new product line and a market that spanned both nationally and internationally.The housing market had a huge appetite for roller trailers and Precision Equipment was able to deliver the premier trailer for the time. Trailers were specifically designed to accommodate the component manufacturers expectations and jobsite needs. Roller trailers ranged from the short 28’ gooseneck which could handle the tightest jobsite to the 53-80’ stretch trailer for much larger projects. With Precision’s reputation and manufacturing abilities known nationally we took great pride when we were commissioned by industry leaders in the Wind Energy Business to build extendable trailers and steerable trailers, extending up to 120 feet for wind blades.Precision Equipment enjoyed success until the housing market dropped. This provided an opportunity to exhibit corporate flexibility. Existing units were sold and a design was developed for agricultural trailers, beginning with hopper bottom grain trailers and end dump sugar beet trailers. With this new undertaking there was also the realization that a company owned paint facility that could create a high quality paint coating at a reasonable price was necessary to be competitive. Precision Equipment purchased a paint facility with sand blasting capabilities and room for assembly. Precision Finishes LLC was formed in 2007, providing industrial painting for Precision Equipment and its external customers.Since that time, product lines have been expanded in the agricultural industry which now includes the grain hopper bottom, ag end dump, step deck, tile trailer and the new RGN. Precision also entered the aggregate construction business as well with belly dump gravel trailers, a pup belly dump and side dump construction trailers. Becoming a Meritor OEM supplier has provided for factory direct parts for trailers like axles, valves, braking systems and suspensions, another advantage for customers.Recently, through our advancement in equipment, technology and personnel and fueled by the desire to expand, Precision Equipment started the fabricating; manufacturing and marketing of new design flameless heating units. These units are a new generation of flameless called Rotational Energy. Through the development of this venture, a new dimension of engineering and sales personnel along with a new type of manufacturing with assembly lines, outsourcing and purchasing was added. This new arena changed the total structure of Precision Equipment with different demands and technology. This adventure has provided the opportunity to install an ERP system with processes and procedures these systems require. In addition, a multi-use indirect flame heater that can also be a power source with a light plant was developed: a one unit construction site tri-use unit called the Dragon Wagon.Through all of this growth, Precision Equipment has broken ground for a new facility that will double the building size and allow for multiple bridge cranes to enhance the safety and ease of manufacturing. This also allows the consolidation of the painting facility and the manufacturing facility creating even more efficiencies of scale. This is an exciting time for Precision Equipment, who wishes to thank you for your business and customer loyalty.Bob NelsonPresident of Precision Equipment MFG, LLCExplore Precision Equipment Work For Us Submit An Application Our Manufacturing Explore Manufacturing Our Engineering Explore Engineering Browse Resources Browse Our Resources We Deliver For Our IndustryWe are proud supporters of the Northwestern Lumber Association and the SBCA.

They understand the building process and can get trailers built efficiently and to a high standard. They have been fabricating nearly every component of our trailers in Fargo, North Dakota, for the last 20 years. This means that our team can almost always make your part right here, from scratch, with expertise and attention to detail whenever you need a part. That means no messing with third-party vendors or trying to find an obscure part for your 2015 trailer. Most of our manufacturing crew has been around since the beginning. They’ve seen first-hand what works and what doesn’t. They know what goes into building a trailer that will consistently deliver trusses.The 6 Part Manufacturing Process 1Metal, Meet Metal and Let Fabrication BeginThe fabrication process starts under the watchful eye of Squish. He is responsible for leading the team that runs our massive plasma cutter, CNCs, and water-cooled ban saws. This is where metal meets metal, and we begin fabricating your trailer’s components. 2Strong Welds Unite Your Parts for LifeLike most of our team, our welders have been with us since the beginning. Their welds mirror the strength of these steel-spined American welders. They consistently produce welds that forge a bond that can endure the stressors of our roadways. 3A Lesson For Metal Written in GritSteel-colored shot pellets make our massive shot blasting room feel like a grey sand beach. Standing tall among the grey and in full PPE is Todd and his team. They blast the contaminates from your trailer’s parts, reminding the metal that grit is essential in a long and robust life. 4Primed To Be Prepared For A Long LifeBefore your trailer’s powder coat holds tight, it needs a primer. We use a high-quality PPG Polyurethane primer to prime your trailer’s parts. 5Finished With Custom ColorPowdercoatWhether you choose the standard black or to reinforce your brand at every job site with custom colors, your trailer will receive a durable and long-lasting finish. The powder coat electrostatically bonds to the trailer creating a finish that will represent you well and keep the rust away. 6All of Our Efforts Are Brought Together in AssemblyFinally, we assemble the entire trailer to create the delivery tool you and our sales team discussed. We pay close attention to the details to ensure that your trailer is built with the precision to keep your business strong. Are You Ready to To Put Our Manufacturing To Work For You? Yes.

That’s more than 41,000 hours spent building, testing, revising, and improving our truss trailers and trailer parts. Nearly all these parts are designed and fabricated in-house, giving us total control over the manufacturing process. Our engineering expertise is reinforced by decades of mechanical and trucking knowledge. This makes it easy for us to understand and solve the unique challenges you face when delivering the raw materials of North America’s infrastructure. Engineered For Your Needs Patented Strap Locks Designed For Easier Load SecuringThe patented strap locks are designed to ensure that operators can easily connect a strap without worrying about the strap unhooking when they move to the other side of the trailer. Beyond that, our optional sliding strap locks adjust to allow your driver to position the straps where they are needed. Rollers are Optimized For DeliveryThe 5” diameter rollers are the closest in the industry spaced at 2′ on center and optimized in several ways: 1) The 2′ on center spacing decreases each roller’s load-bearing responsibility 2) They are raised above the side rail to make forklift access easier and to help prevent loads from catching on 3) The dual rear rollers are reinforced to increase the load-bearing capacity of the trailer at its most critical point. Hydraulics Setup For In-Cab Operations When your trailer is in position ready to roll off your trusses, you can control the entire load control the hydraulics from the cab of your truck. This helps your driver make deliveries quickly and efficiently.Want a trailer customized for your needs?

They understand the building process and can get trailers built efficiently and to a high standard. They have been fabricating nearly every component of our trailers in Fargo, North Dakota, for the last 20 years. This means that our team can almost always make your part right here, from scratch, with expertise and attention to detail whenever you need a part. That means no messing with third-party vendors or trying to find an obscure part for your 2015 trailer. Most of our manufacturing crew has been around since the beginning. They’ve seen first-hand what works and what doesn’t. They know what goes into building a trailer that will consistently deliver trusses.The 6 Part Manufacturing Process 1Metal, Meet Metal and Let Fabrication BeginThe fabrication process starts under the watchful eye of Squish. He is responsible for leading the team that runs our massive plasma cutter, CNCs, and water-cooled ban saws. This is where metal meets metal, and we begin fabricating your trailer’s components. 2Strong Welds Unite Your Parts for LifeLike most of our team, our welders have been with us since the beginning. Their welds mirror the strength of these steel-spined American welders. They consistently produce welds that forge a bond that can endure the stressors of our roadways. 3A Lesson For Metal Written in GritSteel-colored shot pellets make our massive shot blasting room feel like a grey sand beach. Standing tall among the grey and in full PPE is Todd and his team. They blast the contaminates from your trailer’s parts, reminding the metal that grit is essential in a long and robust life. 4Primed To Be Prepared For A Long LifeBefore your trailer’s powder coat holds tight, it needs a primer. We use a high-quality PPG Polyurethane primer to prime your trailer’s parts. 5Finished With Custom ColorPowdercoatWhether you choose the standard black or to reinforce your brand at every job site with custom colors, your trailer will receive a durable and long-lasting finish. The powder coat electrostatically bonds to the trailer creating a finish that will represent you well and keep the rust away. 6All of Our Efforts Are Brought Together in AssemblyFinally, we assemble the entire trailer to create the delivery tool you and our sales team discussed. We pay close attention to the details to ensure that your trailer is built with the precision to keep your business strong. Are You Ready to To Put Our Manufacturing To Work For You? Yes.

That’s more than 41,000 hours spent building, testing, revising, and improving our truss trailers and trailer parts. Nearly all these parts are designed and fabricated in-house, giving us total control over the manufacturing process. Our engineering expertise is reinforced by decades of mechanical and trucking knowledge. This makes it easy for us to understand and solve the unique challenges you face when delivering the raw materials of North America’s infrastructure. Engineered For Your Needs Patented Strap Locks Designed For Easier Load SecuringThe patented strap locks are designed to ensure that operators can easily connect a strap without worrying about the strap unhooking when they move to the other side of the trailer. Beyond that, our optional sliding strap locks adjust to allow your driver to position the straps where they are needed. Rollers are Optimized For DeliveryThe 5” diameter rollers are the closest in the industry spaced at 2′ on center and optimized in several ways: 1) The 2′ on center spacing decreases each roller’s load-bearing responsibility 2) They are raised above the side rail to make forklift access easier and to help prevent loads from catching on 3) The dual rear rollers are reinforced to increase the load-bearing capacity of the trailer at its most critical point. Hydraulics Setup For In-Cab Operations When your trailer is in position ready to roll off your trusses, you can control the entire load control the hydraulics from the cab of your truck. This helps your driver make deliveries quickly and efficiently.Want a trailer customized for your needs?
