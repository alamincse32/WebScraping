With his powerful voice and honest approach, Whitmore comes from the land, growing up on a family farm in Lee County, Iowa. Still living on the same farm today, Whitmore has truly taken the time to discover where his center lies, and from that he will not be moved.Whitmore has repeatedly carved his own path, honoring the longstanding tradition of folk music throughout his nearly 20 year career, while always allowing his blues, soul and punk rock influences to shine through. Getting his first break opening for his friend‚Äôs hardcore band with just a banjo in hand, he would discover bands like The Jesus Lizard, Bad Brains, Lungfish and Minutemen and soon learn to play his own brand of rural, roots music with that same DIY ethic.William Elliott Whitmore has been back and forth across the United States and to cities around the world. He‚Äôs toured with such diverse acts as Frank Turner, Trampled By Turtles, Clutch and Chris Cornell to name a few. He‚Äôs appeared on some of the biggest stages around the world including Stagecoach Fest, Byron Bluesfest (Australia) and End of the Road Fest (UK). His willingness to take his show to any playing field has proved invaluable as he turned strangers to diehards with every performance.

Their performance is gritty, authentic music with, as the good Reverend declared, ‚Äúhuman hands playing real instruments.‚Äù This band is American roots music at its finest, steeped in traditions brought forward with a modern sensibility, performed with skill and passion. It has been referred to as the tent revival, with punk energy that is a refreshing splash of cold water to the face. The Reverend Peyton‚Äôs Big Damn Band is like a twenty-year-old bourbon in a room of vodka Red Bulls and PBRs; vintage yet timeless, exciting and still welcoming. With his wife, Breezy, serving as a one-woman amen corner, and Max laying down the floppy-boot-stomp drums behind Peyton‚Äôs National steel slide guitar, the result is a peculiarly infectious blues crusade.

Jade Presents and Fargo Brewing Company are pleased to announce the third annual Rock The Rails. This all-day event will feature two stages and numerous bands crammed into one amped-up lineup. This year will feature ATREYU AND MEMPHIS MAY FIRE We Want Your Misery Tour with Catch Your Breath and many more.ATREYU is a band in the truest sense of the word: five friends who come together to create music for themselves, for each other, and for the thriving community that has forged around it.They are bonds born of time; of joy and sadness; of success and hardship. But most importantly, they are born of an openness that allows five unique creative personalities to unite in something far stronger and far bigger than the sum of its talented parts. It‚Äôs what makes ATREYU ‚Äì frontman Brandon Saller, guitarists Dan Jacobs and Travis Miguel, bassist/vocalist Porter McKnight and drummer Kyle Rosa ‚Äì one of the most respected names and potent forces in heavy music, and their live show one of the most heralded on the touring circuit.‚ÄúWe draw strength from each other and give each other the space and support to be the best, most creative person we can be,‚Äù Dan Jacobs explains. ‚ÄúAnd together, right now, that makes us the best band we‚Äôve ever been.‚ÄùHe‚Äôs not wrong. With a 20-year career and eight acclaimed albums in the rear-view mirror, ATREYU in 2023 are focused only on the present and the future, and a mission to continue shaping and defining the rock and metal scene, just as they have always done since their emergence from Huntington Beach in Southern California.Memphis May Fire makes anthems for the broken. The four-piece rock band channel a generation‚Äôs worth of angst, frustration, and pain, with a focused blend of gigantic melodic hooks and crushing aggression. Even after topping Billboard‚Äôs Hard Music Albums chart and breaking into radio‚Äôs Active Rock Top 20, Memphis May Fire refuses to sacrifice who they are or the people who made them.A new season unfolds for the band, filled with revitalization and renewal. Stripping things down to their core elements, hearkening back to the days when they created the music their fans most cherish, Memphis May Fire rekindled the spark within to build an inferno of riffs and inspirational words.As Memphis May Fire, Matty Mullins, Kellen McGregor, Cory Elder, and Jake Garland confront anxiety, violence, and polarization all over their music, strengthened by a foundation of hope and renewal at the heart of the lyrics. Songs like ‚ÄúBleed Me Dry,‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath Inside,‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly Human,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Fight Within‚Äù evoke the cathartic bombast of the band‚Äôs best-known songs, a return to their roots with the seasoned polish earned through years of touring and making music together.Memphis May Fire has toured with a vast list of important rock and metal acts that include Killswitch Engage, Sleeping With Sirens, Black Veil Brides, Sevendust, and Atreyu. They‚Äôve co-headlined with Yellowcard and The Devil Wears Prada, regularly appeared on Warped Tour, and at major rock festivals. The band‚Äôs previous six albums' continued relevance is a testament to the energized connectivity between the band and their audience. Songs like ‚ÄúMiles Away,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Ordinary Love,‚Äù ‚ÄúBeneath the Skin,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarry On‚Äù account for 100 million views and millions of streams.

Tickets are on sale now ‚Üí bit.ly/461tS5j21+Doors open 7PM | Show 8PMSince 2019, Jessica Vines has been releasing music that connects heart and soul to the body through catchy melodies, a timeless voice and contagious groove. Once again, she ties those together with A Very Good Story, her fourth studio project. Exploring personal events from her past, Jessica Vines bridges the emotions felt to the lessons learned from experiences of heart break, self discovery and triumph in a relatable, yet unique voice. She sets the mood with a nostalgic tone that feels timeless, yet current. In this project, she uses new sounds and textures to bring a deeper level of vulnerability than ever before and brings the message even clearer.Starting with the title track, Vines sets up the EP with a short introduction to explain the overarching message before traveling head first into the tumultuous nature of human relationships and the array of emotions, decisions and consequences that come along with them. With the talents of co-producer and co-writer Evan Geiger, Vines found the process of writing this project cathartic and continues to use the song as a reminder of strength from struggle, which she hopes all listeners will also take with them once listening through.You can find Jessica Vines performing in the Los Angeles area, where she currently resides, and all over the Midwest, where she started her career back in 2017 and frequents for shows and festivals. Catch her at a show to hear the songs in their most engaging and interactive form.
