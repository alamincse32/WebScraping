From origins in leather power-transmission belts and classic fire trucks, our business has always been based on dedication to serving customer needs and fostering strong partnerships. Headquartered in Arden Hills, MN, we serve customers via ten locations in North America. 0 founding year 0 Divisions 0 Locations 0 % Committed An Eclectic History William S. Nott founded Nott Company in 1879, beginning the business by supplying leather drive belts for the milling and lumber industries. Belts were then made from animal hides using water power from St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River, near what is now downtown Minneapolis. By the early 1900s, products evolved from luggage, horse harnesses, and leather dice cups to hand-drawn fire engines, steam pumps, and motorized fire engines. Remnants of the old fire equipment can still be found throughout Nott Company’s offices today.By the 1960s, the business had evolved and developed two specialty divisions – Rubber Fabrication and Fluid Power. These integral departments provided the design and fabrication of completed rubber products, standard component pieces, total fluid power solutions and engineered systems. Today, these specialties have expanded into Engineered Materials Solutions, Mobile Fluid Power, Industrial Fluid Power, and Industrial Engineered Solutions. Nott Company and its four divisions now employ hundreds of people across eight locations around the midwest. As an employee-owned (ESOP) company, we are confident that our dedication to growth and change will carry us successfully through the 21st century. 2021 Mission Nott Company strives to serve the best engineering solutions and integrated processes in the industrial, fluid power, and engineered materials markets. We achieve this through enthusiasm, innovation, and outstanding service to keep foundational industries moving forward with ease. vision Our vision is to be the lead partner in engineering, systems, and supply chain solutions.

Click here Applications We have over 50 years of experience in helping customers with their applications needs. Gaskets A gasket is a mechanical seal that fills the gap between two objects, preventing leakage while the objects are under use. A certain amount of “give” is beneficial to allow the gasket to conform to any irregularities of the surfaces on either side of it.Some common applications for gaskets include electrical enclosure gaskets, weatherstripping, EMI/RFI shielding, leak protection, and dust skirts. Seals A seal is a mechanical device which helps join systems or objects together, preventing leakage associated with pressure or contamination.Some common applications for seals include moisture barriers, diaphragms, separators, air/water filters, custom o-rings, and squeegees/wipers. Insulators An insulator is a material that resists the flow of heat, electricity, sound, or vibration, which stops, reduces, or minimizes the flow to acceptable levels.Some common applications for insulators include electrical insulators, thermal shields and conductors, EMI/RFI shields, gap fillers, cab liner insulation, sound absorption, and vibration isolation. Cushions A cushion helps protect items from vibration, shock, or impact, either from environmental causes or during transportation.Some common applications for cushions include friction pads, foot pads, vibration damping, surface protection, shock absorption, packaging, and case inserts. Masking Products Masking materials are used to protect the surface of a finished product from contaminants. Production Aids Production aids are used as a functional component in the manufacturing process or to reduce the environmental impact on the operator.
