Our manufacturing, engineering and project management experience allows us to consistently provide high-quality construction and storage solutions. Unlike other companies, TrueNorth Steel is an all-in-one solution. From planning to delivering the final product to your site, we have you covered. In addition to manufacturing, we manage our own fleet of trucks, allowing us to bring materials to you and eliminate the hassle of arranging logistics yourself.

Our team works closely with engineers, architects and construction managers, tailoring the level of service and assistance to each client’s unique needs. From concept to fabrication and assembly, we remain a true partner. How can we make that promise? One simple concept has guided our business since 1945: Be the reliable, dependable provider of the steel products our customers demand. We combine our decades of experience with a detailed understanding of each project to find the best steel solution for customers in agriculture, construction, mining, road building, energy, and a variety of other industries. Since 2011, the following businesses were aligned under the TrueNorth Steel name: Johnston Fargo Culvert Huron Culvert and Tank Fargo Tank and Steel Dakota Steel and Supply Mandan Steel Fabricators Precision Stair and Steel Roscoe Steel and Culvert Beck Steel TrueNorth Steel Our History TrueNorth Steel’s story began in 1945 when Ole Rommesmo Sr., a Norwegian immigrant, launched his first company: Fargo Tank. From the very beginning, the business reflected Ole Sr., his values, and his principles. Integrity, humility, focus, commitment, and knowledge. These words describe Ole Sr., and they represent the entire TrueNorth Steel team today. In the decades that followed, the business grew through acquisitions, creating a diverse portfolio of steel products and capabilities while extending the company’s reach across North America. Huron Culvert and Tank, Minnkota Windows, Mandan Steel, Johnston Fargo Culvert, FTC Transport, Dakota Steel, Precision Stair and Steel, Roscoe Steel and Culvert, and Beck Steel were added. The businesses were known by their names individually. Collectively they became businesses of The Rommesmo Companies. Ole Rommesmo, Jr. now leads the business, and in 2011, Ole Jr. integrated The Rommesmo Companies’ steel businesses into a single organization, forming TrueNorth Steel. TrueNorth Steel carries the company’s more than seven decades of history into the future – continuing to deliver on the values of integrity, humility, focus, commitment, and knowledge on which Ole Sr. founded the business and continuing to serve its customers with reliable steel products they can count on. TrueNorth Steel Mission | Vision | Values The mission of TrueNorth Steel is to be an industry leader in quality manufactured and fabricated steel products for profit. TrueNorth Steel will adhere to a culture of building leadership, continuous improvement and will always be accountable and respectful to its employees, customers, suppliers and owners by providing solutions and building trust. The vision of TrueNorth Steel and FTC Transport is to understand our customers and provide the best products, services, and solutions to make them look good.

TrueNorth Steel has excellent benefits and pay but mostly, I enjoy the people! They are so nice! They’re always willing to help me locate an item or tell a story. This new inventory job has me enjoying coming to work again! I miss my logistics co-workers in Fargo (Lori, Sue and Holly) but the new inventory co-workers are making the adjustment easier. Thank you! What part of your job do you enjoy the most? Inventory, as we all know, can be like looking for Waldo! The longer I do this job, the easier it is to locate the items needed. I’ve been doing some cleaning and organizing (which has helped a lot!) My goal is to locate items, like the past inventory people could do. They always seemed like heroes and I want to have that feeling. What advice do you have for someone just starting out in your role? Be aware of your surroundings and wear your PPE. When you start out, be open to other positions and opportunities other than what you applied for. Every day give it your all and it will be awesome! Share a hobby you have or some fun fact about you.

From the first conversation to the last bolt placement, TrueNorth Steel provides guidance and support to ensure your bridge project is trouble free and a success for all stakeholders. By utilizing prefabricated bridge modules assembled on site as opposed to conventional construction methods, project installation timelines can be shortened by days or weeks. Together we can develop your ideal bridge by drawing upon our experience with the numerous available bridge styles, deck types, safety railing and material finishes. While some bridge manufacturers are limited to utilizing mill rolled girders, TrueNorth Steel also manufactures bridges utilizing welded steel plate girders. Welded steel plate girders can be fabricated to a much greater beam depth than mill rolled beams. Thus, welded steel plate girders often provide a more cost-effective solution and allow clear spans to 280 feet. We pre-fabricate bridge components in our AISC-certified facilities, where we only use U.S. sourced materials, American Welding Society certified welders and comprehensive quality control processes to ensure your bridge exceeds your expectations.

In some cases, complete culvert replacement isn’t necessary. In fact, many counties and cities opt for culvert rehabilitation instead of replacement because it offers many benefits. Culverts Rehabilitation Benefits No roadway shutdown No traffic re-routing No disruption of the pavement and roadway embankment Minimize drainage disruption Overall lower cost than removal and replacementlife Get a Quote Brochures & Resources See Our Work Why TrueNorth Steel Multiple Culvert Rehabilitation Options TrueLiner™ As America’s infrastructure ages, owners, contractors and engineers are challenged to determine effective methods to keep roads and bridges functional and safe for users. The most common structures, and in many cases the oldest structures, are culverts and small bridges.

LEARN MORE END TREATMENTS Flared End Sections, Safety Slopes, Safety Aprons, and Guards Find Your Local Contact Culvert Rehabilitation End-Treatments Structural Plate Drainage Gates TrueNorth Steel Long Lasting, easy To Maintain Our end treatments are not only long-lasting and easy to maintain, they are up to standards – made from certified materials meeting AASHTO and ASTM standards, and federal and state highway agency requirements for safety and hydraulic efficiency. Standard flared end sections are more common however we also offer safety slope end sections and safety aprons with optional bar sets. We will advise availability for the right end treatment for your situation. View NCSPA Design Manual View Standard Details Why TrueNorth Steel Multiple End Treatment Options Bevel Cuts Bevel cuts can be done in several fashions. Step bevels are recommended for all pipe sizes. Step bevels are typically limited to 3:1, 2:1, or steeper slopes on long span and larger structural plate pipe, depending on their rise. Full and partial bevels are typically applicable only to smaller pipe. The NCSPA Design Manual is your guide to the best option on a bevel cut for your project. We also have standard detail drawings on optional bevel cuts for your reference. Headwalls Prefabricated steel headwalls are designed to accommodate pipe diameters from 12” to 144”, skewed end pipes and pipe arches. Wingwalls, if required, can be designed and provided as well. Headwalls are pre-attached to the end of the pipe and pre-assembled at the factory to assure proper fit and finish. Standard Flared End Sections Standard flared end sections are not only long-lasting and easy to maintain, they are up to standards and easy to install. Matching the fill slopes, the end section “finishes” the appearance of the culvert and keeps grass, weeds and debris from the culvert opening. It also increases flow characteristics, preventing scouring and undercutting. Available in sizes 6” to 96” round, as well as arched sizes 17”x13” to 112”x75” with a standard 2:1 slope. The NCSPA Design Manual is a great source for what end finish is best for your job. Safety Slope End Sections Safety slope end sections have contributed greatly to improved highway safety for motorists, while increasing the hydraulic capacity of the culvert with their smooth, long, and narrow design. They are available in 4:1 and 6:1 slopes and feature optional traversable parallel or cross-drain bars. All hardware is included to attach the safety slope end section to your corrugated steel pipe. The NCSPA Design Manual is a great source for what end finish is best for your job. Safety Apron End Sections Safety apron end sections have also contributed greatly to improved highway safety for motorists, while increasing the hydraulic capacity of the culvert. Their cutback designs are corrugated, long and narrow attached with a band. They are available in 4:1, 6:1, and 10:1 slopes and feature optional parallel grates. The NCSPA Design Manual is a great source for what end finish is best for your job. Rodent Guards Steel Rodent Guards are easy to install and prevent rodents and other pests from plugging your drainage systems. These guards position far enough in the pipe that it can swivel up and allow trash to pass without exposing the Rodent Guard beyond the pipe. Depending on the diameter needed, the structural design may vary but all have the same end goal. Steel Trash Guards Steel Trash Guards, also known as Child Protection Grates, are designed to fit onto a standard flared end section. They are used to prevent unwanted material from entering the pipe which may result in clogging. Drainage Gates Drainage gates can be used to permit the free flow of water from a pipe while preventing against backflow or offer reliable water control on pipe systems .

LEARN MORE UNDERGROUND GASOLINE TANKS reliable and safe storage of fuel products Find Your Local Contact Plasteel® Elutron® Double Walled Steel / Fiberglass Jacketed Fuel Storage System Steel tank fuel containment systems have a well-established history of providing reliable and safe storage of fuel products including gasoline, diesel, ethanol, JET A, AVGAS, and Diesel Exhaust Fluids (DEF). Plasteel® Elutron® underground fuel storage tanks incorporate the time-proven strength and reliability of steel tanks with a unique impervious fiberglass reinforced (FRP) outer secondary containment layer. This seamless outer FRP layer creates a barrier that protects the steel tank from the potentially corrosive effect of underground environments. The 360º interstice between the steel and FRP secondary containment is created by incorporating an aluminum foil layer that provides a system for monitoring inner tank integrity. The UL Listed Elutron® Double-Walled Fiberglass Jacketed tank system meets the EPA 40 CFR subpart B, 280.20 standards for new underground storage tanks. WHAT MATTERS MOST Reliability: No documented external corrosion failure of any Plastee ® tank. Satisfaction: 30-year Limited Warranty Sizes and Capacities: 560 to 40,000-gallon capacity, 4 to 12 feet in diameter Versatility: Compatible with gasoline, ethanol blends from E10 to E100, diesel, bio-diesel blends from B2 to B100, fuel oil, methanol, and isobutanol and additives (Can be lined internally for special applications e.g., DEF, jet fuel, non-potable water storage) Customization: Available with multiple compartments for multiple fuel storage Cost-effectiveness: Lower installed cost than fiberglass underground fuel storage tanks due to less excavation and backfill material. Learn more about Excavation/Backfill Comparison here. Sustainability: Steel is 100% recyclable Get a Quote Brochures & Resources See Our Work ABOUT TRUENORTH STEEL Quality is built into every tank system TrueNorth Steel fabricates. Our production facilities are certified and regularly audited by the American Petroleum Institute, Steel Tank Institute, and Underwriters Laboratories. TrueNorth Steel is a reliable partner with over 75 years of experience fabricating a wide array of superior steel tank products, including horizontal and vertical tanks, single-wall and double-wall above-ground fuel storage tanks, Fireguard® protected fuel storage systems, Flameshield® fire-tested tanks, and petroleum storage tanks for oilfield applications. All of our welders are American Welding Society certified and TrueNorth Steel maintains a comprehensive Quality Management System that guides each aspect of our steel fabrication, including sourcing, planning, and manufacturing processes. INSTALLATION Installation of Elutron® underground storage tanks is simple and easy due to their inherent stiffness when compared to fiberglass tanks which require deflection monitoring during backfilling. Elutron® tanks usually require a smaller excavation footprint and less backfill while fiberglass tanks require higher-quality gravel backfill and a greater distance between adjacent tanks. TrueNorth Steel tanks are easy to install and arrive with precast concrete deadman anchors and either steel or polyester tie-down straps. Elutron® tanks can be supplied with a factory-established interstitial vacuum. Prior to delivery, our team cleans and levels all the fittings and marks the center lines on each tank. These details save installers several hours of work normally spent on the pre-installation testing and cleaning of non-metallic tanks. TrueNorth Steel delivers Elutron® tanks with vacuums applied and center lines marked to simplify and expedite installation. TECHNOLOGY Elutron’s unique and time-proven double-walled, fiberglass jacketed tank technology provides reliable performance, safety, and ease of installation. The inner steel tank is designed to contain gasoline, JET A, AVGAS, Diesel, DEF, and methanol/ethanol in varying concentrations. The outer fiberglass “FRP” jacket and inner steel tank are separated by an interstitial space allowing monitoring of tank integrity. The outer FRP jacket acts as a corrosion barrier against aggressive and corrosion underground conditions ensuring outstanding long-term tank performance The UL Listed Elutron® Double Walled Fiberglass Jacketed tank system meets the EPA 40 CFR subpart B, 280.20 standards for new underground storage tanks. Tank built and tested in accordance with UL58 Steel Underground Tanks for Flammable and Combustible Liquids, and UL1746 External Corrosion Protection Systems for Steel Underground Storage Tanks. Inner UL-58 Steel Tank Interstitial Standoff Material Fiberglass Outer Jacket Layer Completed Elutron® Tank Three-compartment 20,000-gallon Elutron tank. Can include a separate DEF-only compartment. Elutron® tanks are compatible with most fiberglass sump collars WARRANTY Plasteel® Elutron® Warranty: “System will not fail due to internal or external corrosion for a period of 30 years from the date of shipment when used to store all motor fuels, including but not limited to, unleaded gasoline, leaded gasoline, in any alcohol blend percentages, 100% methanol, 100% ethanol, diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, or fuel oil.” Inquire with TrueNorth Steel for full warranty.

LEARN MORE ARCHITECTURAL Structural Steel Find Your Local Contact Architectural Commercial Industrial Civil Miscellaneous Steel TrueRail® TrueStair® STEEL IN MODERN ARCHITECTURE Steel has long been the preferred material for architectural framework, but when it’s recognized for its innate beauty as well as its structural integrity, the results can be awe-inspiring. Revered architects have challenged the idea of using steel merely to construct a building’s skeleton and have instead created innovative and surprisingly fluid structures that allow the material to take center stage. What’s more, many modern architects are experimenting with the aesthetics of steel, from cultivating rust for an aged patina to polishing for a high shine to bronzing for a warmer finish. Our team has experience working on all facets of structural steel manufacturing and fabrication, from pre-construction to installation. We have worked on hundreds of high profile projects in commercial, industrial, and civil applications to make your architectural vision a reality out of structural steel. At TrueNorth Steel, we work closely with the construction team, combining their vision with our experience to ensure building projects are designed, fabricated and built to specifications, on time and as efficiently as possible. We visualize each project’s use of structural steel from both an architectural and structural engineering perspective, with an emphasis on: • Applications and uses of innovative design and construction methods• Aesthetic and visual impact of the project • Innovative use of architecturally exposed structural steel • Technical or architectural advances in the use of the steel • Sustainability, Green Initiatives SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ANAHEIM REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION INTERMODAL CENTER Certifications AISC Building Fabricator (BU) AISC Bridge & Highway Components (CPT) AISC Bridge Fabricator – Advanced (ABR) AISC Fracture Critical Endorsement – (FCE) AISC Special Paint Endorsement – Enclosed (P1) Designed & Fabricated to applicable AASHTO/ASTM Standards City of Los Angeles Certified Fabricator WABO (Washington Area Building Officials) Certified Fabricator CWB (Canadian Welding Bureau) Certified Fabricator AWS (American Welding Society) Certified Welding Fabricator Get a Quote Brochures & Resources SEE OUR WORK Our Structural Steel Team Our team has experience in all facets of structural steel manufacturing and fabrication, from pre-construction to operations.

LEARN MORE TRUERAIL® Structural Steel Find Your Local Contact Architectural Commercial Industrial Civil Miscellaneous Steel TrueRail® TrueStair® Structural Steel Services Add Aesthetic Appeal to Railing Systems The TrueRail system provides complete flexibility and control to create elaborate and aesthetically appealing railings. TrueRail can be used with most existing or new steel rail concepts. When looking for the ultimate in custom design flexibility, TrueRail sections offer a retrofit solution to existing rail systems, while being cost effective, reducing installation time, and code compliant. Certifications AISC Building Fabricator (BU) AISC Bridge & Highway Components (CPT) AISC Bridge Fabricator – Advanced (ABR) AISC Fracture Critical Endorsement – (FCE) AISC Special Paint Endorsement – Enclosed (P1) Designed & Fabricated to applicable AASHTO/ASTM Standards City of Los Angeles Certified Fabricator WABO (Washington Area Building Officials) Certified Fabricator CWB (Canadian Welding Bureau) Certified Fabricator AWS (American Welding Society) Certified Welding Fabricator Why TrueRail® Cost Effective & Customizable Designs  Appealing Solutions for Architects One of the biggest benefits of TrueRail is that it provides architects with complete control when creating complicated steel rail designs. TrueRail is designed not to replace current steel rail solutions, but to offer an additional layer of customization. With that in mind, TrueRail can be used with most existing and new steel rail systems. For architects looking for design flexibility, TrueRail offers the ability to enhance the aesthetic appeal of 8-line and picket rail systems already in place. j Customizable Design TrueRail features a customizable design, making it the perfect solution for a wide range of projects. Designs can be chosen using our library of designs, or architects can work directly with TrueNorth Steel to create a totally custom design. Rail panels can also be fabricated to include accent colors and logos for a cohesive, branded look.  Cost Effective TrueRail is a more economical solution to current rail systems. Users now have the ability to create a customized design for the same price or less than other steel rail systems on the market. In addition, TrueRail can be used with existing steel rail systems rather than replacing the whole system. Not only is this more cost-effective, but it also saves time. } Reduce Production Times Our TrueRail system functions with most existing steel rail systems and the installation are as easy as swapping out spindles with the custom rail panels. TrueRail panels can be installed in as little as a third of the time it takes to install 8-line and picket rail systems.  Increased Safety At TrueNorth Steel, we believe safety is paramount and our products reflect that. Each TrueRail system is designed to be safety compliant and meets the specifications outlined in both local and state codes.

Permanent Erosion Control Flexamat® is a permanent erosion control mat utilized for stabilizing slopes, channels, low water crossings, inlet/outlet protection, and shorelines. Tied Concrete Block Mat is a generic term for Flexamat®. It consists of concrete blocks (6.5˝ x 6.5˝ with a 2.25˝ profile) locked together and embedded into a high strength geogrid. There is 1.5˝ spacing between the blocks that gives the mat flexibility and allows for optional vegetation growth. The mat is packaged in rolls, making transporting and installing Flexamat® efficient. It is manufactured with various underlayments, determined by onsite conditions. Available Configurations: Standard Flexamat ® is manufactured with the Aspen wood excelsior, Curlex II ® . This underlayment help establish and encourage vegetation growth. Flexamat Plus is manufactured with Recyclex ® TRM underlayment which is used when a permanent backing is needed. This product is made from recycled soda bottles (nylon fiber that will not float). This backing will allow vegetation growth and will remain permanently as an underlayment if growth isn’t present. This backing is used primarily in arid environments, areas susceptible to drought, areas with poor soils, and shaded areas. Flexamat® may also be supplied with non-woven fabric underlayment. This backing is used in applications where establishing vegetation is not possible or not desired. Non-woven backings should be used for areas exposed to continuous flows or where sandy soils are present Need more information?

LEARN MORE GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS Available in Several Different Configurations Find Your Local Contact Cattle Guards Flexamat Gabions Geosynthetics Sediment & Erosion Control Irrigation & Drainage Gates Geotextiles Time has proven the cost effectiveness of geotextiles and their ability to improve constructability on poor subgrades. Geotextiles can perform a variety of functions that include separation, stabilization, and drainage. Geotextiles are available in woven and nonwoven. Installation survivability is a key component in the selection process of geotextiles. Geogrids It has been said that “roads wear out from the top but fall apart from the bottom.” Geogrids provide a mechanically stabilized layer within or under the aggregate base thereby maintaining structural capacity and improving the long-term performance of the pavement system. Geogrids are available in Biaxial, Triaxial, and Uniaxial. Benefits of Geogrids are they lower total installation costs due to reduced aggregate base layer thickness and they reduced costs associated with long-term maintenance needs. Cellular Confinement Cellular Confinement is a three-dimensional cellular structure resembling a honeycomb configuration that controls shearing and lateral and vertical movement of the infill material. Cellular Confinement systems are highly effective economical solutions to unacceptable road, parking, and yard surface problems. They provide a stiff base with high flexural strength and acts as a semi-rigid slab. It can minimize the impact of differential and overall settlement and may allow for use of poor-quality fills in place of more costly imported material. With a permeable infill, cellular confinement reduces stormwater runoff and can also act as an on-site retention/detention system. Applications include: access roads, sub-ballast structures, trails, boat ramps, low water, crossings, and drivable vegetated surfaces.

Can be used on 3:1 to 2:1 slopes and has a functional longevity of 12 months. For environmentally sensitive areas these blankets are also available with jute biodegradable nets. Double Net Straw & Coconut Constructed of 70% straw and 30% coconut fiber stitched between two long term photodegradable plastic nets. They provide protection on steep slopes and medium flow channels for up to 24 months. The preferred product of most state DOT’s is the straw/coconut blanket with the biodegradable netting, providing protection for up to 18 months. Double Net Coconut Fiber Is a blanket of 100% coconut fiber stitched between two long term photodegradable nets. This will bring the highest level of protection for severe slopes, steep embankments and high flow channels. Coconut blankets provide protection for up to 36 months. The biodegradable net option provides protection for up to 24 months. Turf Reinforcement Mats A permanent turf reinforcement mats allow vegetation to be used for scour prevention where flow conditions exceed the shear limits of natural vegetation. The permanent turf mat reinforces the root-and-stem systems of the vegetation and protects against the high shear stress water flow. We will advise availability of the right TRM for your situation. Flexamat® (Tied Concrete Block Mat is a generic term for Flexamat.) Flexamat consists of concrete shapes, locked together with a high strength, polypropylene geogrid. There are openings around each concrete block that give Flexamat the flexibility and enable it to be packaged in rolls. The openings also allow vegetation to grow through the mat. Eventually, vegetation will completely cover Flexamat. It can be manufactured with various backings such as non-woven fabric to stop vegetation growth or a TRM (turf re-enforcement mat) depending on the soil conditions and other factors. There’s a wide range of applications where Flexamat is utilized, but it is most commonly used for erosion control. Flexamat is used to control erosion in channels, outlet protection, on slopes, for shoreline protection and many other applications. Flexamat offers permanent, hard armor protection, with a natural vegetated appearance. Flexamat may be mowed over with commercial mowing equipment or left to grow wild. Besides grass, there are many other types of native plant species that can be planted to grow within the mat. For example, Willow Saplings were planted through Flexamat for a streambank re-vegetation project. View All Flexamat Brochures & Resources TrueNorth Steel Sediment Control TrueNorth Steel strives to be your preferred supplier by providing the necessary construction products for your project from start to finish, as well as providing products to meet state and federal specifications. It all begins with controlling the sediment on your job site. Products include: Straw Wattles made from weed free straw fibers confined in a plastic mesh. Available in 9” and 12” diameter rolls. Excelsior Wattles made from wood excelsior fibers that allows for water permeability at the same time filtering sediment.Available in 9” and 12” diameter rolls. Silt Fence which is the most commonly used sediment control tool is available with or without stakes, and with or without wire backing. Compost Sock Palletized Compost Filter Sock is a mesh tube filled with composted wood debris to help keep mud and other pollutants out of waterways. During rain events, water “ponds” behind Compost Filter Sock, then seeps through – the pollutants either settle out or are filtered out. With compost sock, total installation costs are far less than straw wattles or silt fence. Extensive testing shows Compost Filter Sock outperforms silt fence and straw wattle products. They meet USDA-NRCS, AASHTO, USACE, and EPA specifications as well as those of many State Agencies.

From the first conversation to the last bolt placement, TrueNorth Steel provides guidance and support to ensure your bridge project is trouble free and a success for all stakeholders. By utilizing prefabricated bridge modules assembled on site as opposed to conventional construction methods, project installation timelines can be shortened by days or weeks. Together we can develop your ideal bridge by drawing upon our experience with the numerous available bridge styles, deck types, safety railing and material finishes. While some bridge manufacturers are limited to utilizing mill rolled girders, TrueNorth Steel also manufactures bridges utilizing welded steel plate girders. Welded steel plate girders can be fabricated to a much greater beam depth than mill rolled beams. Thus, welded steel plate girders often provide a more cost-effective solution and allow clear spans to 280 feet. We pre-fabricate bridge components in our AISC-certified facilities, where we only use U.S. sourced materials, American Welding Society certified welders and comprehensive quality control processes to ensure your bridge exceeds your expectations.

This prestigious recognition showcases the outstanding contributions of individuals in the manufacturing industry who are making a difference in their communities and beyond. Jodie Mjoen, the President/CEO of Impact Dakota, expressed her gratitude to all manufacturing employees, recognizing the importance of their work and the products they create, “With over 27,000 manufacturing employees in North Dakota, these hard-working individuals play a crucial role in delivering essential goods not only to local communities but also to customers across the United States and around the world.” The 2023 Faces of Manufacturing list features ten winners and two honorable mentions out of over 100 nominees from more than 30 companies. The list and surrounding campaign celebrate North Dakota’s diverse workforce in every level of manufacturing. The selected individuals represent the vibrancy and diversity of skillsets within North Dakota’s manufacturing economy. TrueNorth Steel proudly recognizes the achievements of Yevgeniy Patselov and all the honorees on the Faces of Manufacturing list. The commitment to excellence and dedication to their craft are a testament to the bright future of manufacturing in North Dakota. With over 44 years of experience in the manufacturing industry, Patselov’s journey as a welder began at the young age of 16 in Azerbaijan. He honed his craft and expertise while working as a pipe welder in Tula, Russia, for approximately six years before immigrating to Fargo, ND, in 1996. Today, as a long tenured and highly skilled Welder 3 in TrueNorth Steel’s West Fargo Bridge manufacturing site, Patselov is responsible for welding and fabricating modular vehicular and pedestrian bridges, along with wide flange and plate girder bridges. Yevgeniy’s versatility and expertise make him a true asset to TrueNorth Steel’s bridge division. Another remarkable aspect of Patselov’s career is his commitment to mentoring and guiding new hires. His knowledge and experience have been invaluable in shaping the skills of aspiring welders joining the team. Patselov’s passion for his craft and his dedication to his colleagues have created a positive and inspiring work environment at TrueNorth Steel. When asked what he would say to youth who may not be considering manufacturing as a potential career option, Patselov said, “If you want to create something magnificent out of nothing then manufacturing is where you want to be. You don’t need to be scared of the industry. There are a lot of people out there willing to teach and mentor you. You just got to love it to do it.” Patselov’s dedication, positivity, and unmatched welding skills have inspired and shaped the next generation of welders within the company. TrueNorth Steel remains committed to fostering a diverse and skilled workforce that continues to drive innovation and excellence in the manufacturing industry.
