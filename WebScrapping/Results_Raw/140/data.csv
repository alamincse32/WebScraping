Used Pallets Many customers find recycled pallets to be the best, most affordable platform for warehousing and shipping their goods. Every recycled pallet we supply has been carefully inspected, graded, and repaired, if necessary, before shipping. The standard 48” x 40”, four-way entry pallet is the most serviceable pallet in the economy today, and we offer them in two grades: A-Grade (#1) A-grade (#1) recycled pallets have new or original runners that are fully intact, sound, and free of repairs. A-Grade pallets with 6” lead boards are available. B-Grade (#2) B-grade (#2) recycled pallets have one or more runner repairs.
