Most of our dog name tags are made from thick stainless steel or solid brass of only the finest quality. We don't cut corners when it comes to pet tag materials. Lower quality metals can't stand up to the laser engraving process we put our tags through. Our dog tag customization heritage started back in 2005 when dogIDs.com was strictly a dog ID tag online storefront. At that time we produced just a handful of traditional hanging style ID tags for dogs. Brass personalized dog tags, and that was the extent of our product line. No name plates, collars, leashes, harnesses or any of the other products we now handcraft in our shop. That's changed drastically over the years. We still produce pet tags for dogs primarily but, we love all animals and ship pet ID tags to customers all over the world for many kinds of pets...all shapes and sizes. Dog tags are an iconic product with a long history in the pet industry and here at dogIDs too. Pet Tags for All Needs and Preferences Since then we've expanded our offering of custom dog tags to hundreds of styles, shapes and colors, to accommodate all of the unique pet tag needs our customers have. Our traditional round dog name tags and bone-shaped dog tags are the most popular dog tag shapes that we make. However, many of our customers also love our military dog tags for their pets, because there's a little more space to fit more customized text and make the font a little larger. Whatever shape your prefer though, you can rest assured that each tag shape we offer is produced with thick stainless steel or solid brass, to make sure your dog tag continues looking fantastic no matter what your dog puts it through. Custom Dog ID Tags Expands to Personalized Dog Collars As time went by and people became more educated about dog identification, we noticed the trend shifting toward engraved dog collar name plates and personalized dog collars as well. We got right to it. It helped of course that our founder, Clint, built a couple of other dog accessory businesses in the past that made collars, dog ID tags and leashes. He just so happened to have designed several custom dog tag, collar and leash product lines during those ventures. Dog collars with personalization were a natural fit and have become a big part of our product lines. So naturally, we recommend both dog tags and personalized collars for double identification protection. Pet ID Tags Return Dogs Home Swiftly Dog tags have been around for a long time and they are still a one of the most effective, practical and stylish ways to make sure our furry friends always have contact information on them at all times, to ensure fast return home to their family if they ever happen to get lost. A Custom Pet Tag is a Simple Wardrobe Upgrade for Your Dog There are also fashion and convenience aspects to traditional style dog tags. They're easy to swap from collar to collar or to harnesses depending on the look you want or if you want different contact information on your dog or your various dog accessories at different times. Top Quality Custom Dog Tags That Last We don't just use average materials for our pet tags. All of our dog ID tags are made with only the highest quality stainless steel and solid brass with generous thickness to ensure they don't bend or break. Dogs can be really hard on products, we know that all too well here at dogIDs, which is actually why the company was originally started. Only the best for your best friend. We also use high power lasers to customize your information and make sure it never wears off - And we guarantee it won't for the life of your pet. The lasers we use for engraving actually vaporize the metal to remove it and then harden the metal underneath which also produces a nice dark surface area, an actual engraving etch mark, not just a black mark by discoloring the metal. Our laser engraved custom dog tags are deeply engraved for an important reason. Your personal contact information is critical and will be readable if we have anything to do with it.

Our name plates can be easily installed on any flat strap collar with our easy to use two piece rivets. Our nameplates can also be easily attached to your dog's harness or leash. Dog collar name plates provide reliable identification to keep your dog known and safely home, and they won’t ever fall off like some dangling tags can. Our engraved dog collar name plates look classy and we deeply engrave them to ensure your contact information never wears off. Another safety benefit of collar name plates is that they won't get caught on obstacles while your dog is out exploring. dogIDs name plates are available in thick solid brass or stainless steel so they are extremely durable. Make It a Name Plate With No Jingle Noise Our customized dog collar name plates are eye-catching, convenient, and quiet. Pick out a rivet-on name plate with two-piece rivets to install on your dog's collar, or opt for a slide-on nameplate with small slots through which you can thread a collar or leash. Either of these styles ensures your pooch won't jingle-jangle every time he or she walks around the house or gets a drink of water. Just in case you need a few more two-piece rivets to have on hand, we sell those too. With our help, you can ensure that your best friend always has his or her ID on them. Imagine the peace and quiet you'll have with a tag that doesn't jingle on your dog's collar. Find a dog collar name plate at dogIDs today.

This ensures that a finder will always have a quick simple way to contact you just by scanning your dog's QR code with their smartphone and you can get geolocation notifications every time your dog's code is scanned if you choose.

Here you will find all of the custom pet tags for cats we produce that will look great on your cat's collar or harness. Make sure your furry friend stays Known and Safely Home! Custom cat ID tags are very important as we all know how easily cats can escape and wander so effortlessly and catching them to return home is often very difficult. We highly recommend our personalized TINY collars for cats as pet tags can easily get caught on obstacles while while your cat is out and about, causing the tag to fall off or much worse, cause your cat to get entangled with obstacles. Some people also like wearing our personalized TINY collars as bracelets too. Pet ID tags for cats are a necessity, but personalized pet collars for cats are even a safer option better in our opinion. And did you know we don't just make pet ID tags for cats and dogs? Yep, we make pet tags for all kinds of animals all the time. Goats, sheep, cows, horses, ferrets, you name it, we've made them. We even make dog tags for humans as well. Our Commitment to Quality dogIDs’ tags are guaranteed for the life of your pet. If you find any part of our workmanship to be unsatisfactory, we will replace your custom ID tags for your cats at no cost to you. Our high-power fiber lasers meticulously engrave custom information into each tag deeply and the engraved surface is hardened during the process to increase engraving longevity even more. We guarantee our tags won’t fade or wear out over time. There is a big difference between our high-power deep laser engraving technique and others who mark tags on the surface of the metal with less powerful lasers. Don't settle for tags that need to be replaced frequently due to contact information wearing off. Our pets' safety is way too important. Let's keep them known and safely home!

Clint, our founder, designed the ScruffTag Collar because he was frustrated with the lack of options in the market for a custom dog collar with name plate that could really stand up to the active lifestyle of his dogs. It’s now over a decade later and our personalized ScruffTag Collars are still the most popular product in our brand! Our customers love the ability to personalize their dog’s collar and eliminate ID tags that make noise and get caught on things. They also love that the ScruffTag nameplate sits right on the scruff of their dog's neck so their contact information is really easy to read. At the end of the day, the purpose of a personalized dog collar is to keep your dog safe and get them home quickly if they get lost, and that’s what these custom dog collars are built for. 18+ Styles to Choose From Our ScruffTag Collar line now includes waterproof, reflective, nylon and leather custom dog collars with ScruffTag name plates built right in. No matter your preferences, we'd love to custom handcraft a ScruffTag collar just for your dog. Every dogIDs ScruffTag Collar is made in the USA and comes with a lifetime guarantee.

When a collar doesn't have a tag, you have nothing to lose—literally! With our name plate dog collars, you don't have to fear that your dog's tag will fall off or break, which can be a worry with some dangling dog tags. Instead, consider a dog collar without the ""dog tag jingle"" like these that have a laser engraved name plate riveted right onto the collar. NamePlate Collars Have Safety Benefits These no-noise dog collars keep your dog's contact information highly visible so if your dog ever does get lost, it's that much easier for someone who finds your dog to see your contact information. No need to search under your dog's jowls to find a hanging dog tag. Enjoy the ease of a handsome collar that has the name plate permanently riveted on, and the added safety of an easier to read ID tag. Another safety aspect of our NamePlate collars is that the name plate will never get caught on things like traditional hanging dog tags can, since they are riveted tightly against the collar strap. Can't-Miss Name Plates Explore our collection of dog collars with an engraved name plate for an eye-catching, easy to read personalized collar that will keep your dog known and safely home and feeling more than a little special. Depending on your dog's activity level, you can choose from many durable materials, such as nylon or canvas. If you need something that's waterproof, we have many personalized dog collar options as well. Want your pooch to strut down the street with that classy leather look? Grab a leather dog collar with a laser engraved personalized ID plate to spoil your pooch. In each case, you can feel confident that the tags will never jingle.

We're firm believers that collars, harnesses, and leashes can be both fun and functional—and fashionable too! In a practical sense, any dog can benefit from an embroidered collar since your contact information is right on the collar, removing the need for a jingling ID tag. Not only can dogIDs embroider your dog's name on his or her collar, but we can also include identifying information, such as your phone number or address. Our assortment of embroidered dog collars is so wide-ranging that you won't have a problem designing your own color scheme that matches your pup's personality or uncovering the perfect collar for a holiday or special event. All of our custom embroidered dog collars are made with premium quality, silky smooth, heavy duty nylon webbing that you will be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Once you have one of these collars in your hand, you'll realize there is a huge difference between ours and the others on the market. Collars for Every Occasion Our embroidered dog collars come in a variety of colors, sizes, and materials. Nylon collars are ideal for day-to-day wear because the material is durable. The same goes for canvas and suede collars. For dogs in colder climates or pooches who always feel a little chilly, have a thick embroidered dog collar. You can choose collars that do more than ID your dog, too. We also offer collars that let folks know you have a service dog. Medical alert collars too that can reveal medical conditions for you or your dog, depending on what's applicable. One Festive Pup Our personalized embroidered dog collars are also fun on special occasions since they are so colorful and you can design the color combinations just for your dog. Celebrate a holiday, such as Christmas, Halloween, or Valentine's Day. With a themed collar, your pooch can join the festivities. Not only can you find a collar that displays your wedding hashtag, but you can even pick out a proposal collar so that your pup can participate when you pop the question. Discover embroidered dog collars at dogIDs, and pair them with durable personalized dog leashes! Subscribe to our newsletter Join our email list for deals, pet parent tips and new products!

Our customers really liked the idea of a dog collar with a personalized buckle, as it eliminated the need for a dog ID tag, name plate or other identification on the dog's collar, and because quick release buckles are so handy. It's not quite as visible as embroidered collars or a ScruffTag collar but it is very convenient and simple with minimal moving parts. It obviously caught on swiftly as personalized buckle collars have become very popular. Were we the first to do this type of dog collar personalization? Maybe, but that doesn't matter. What does matter is that we've had many years experience developing and making this type of personalized collar our own high quality way from scratch. Quality Personalized Buckles Over Quantity We still engrave personalized dog collar buckles deeply and therefore are very choosy about which buckles we use for this process. The metal buckles we use must be able to withstand the high heat conditions we expose them to with our lasers so the buckle plating doesn't peel or crack over time and we also only use metal buckles that we've thoroughly field tested to make sure they stay latched no matter what our dogs put them through. When it comes to plastic or polymer dog collar buckles, the same applies. They have to be super durable so we can ensure our customers that the engraved information will stay legible for many years and the buckles will stay tough as nails as well.

Our custom martingale collars for dogs at dogIDs can help you train your dog more effectively and in a humane manner so that walks are more enjoyable for both you and your canine companion. These humane training tools help get your pup used to a leash more efficiently by applying limited equal pressure around his or her neck when you make a correction or when they pull. This neck ""squeezing"" function helps your dog realize you want them to pay attention to you the moment you give a pull on the lead. For dogs who pull aggressively, run after people and other pooches on walks, or resist your commands, a martingale dog collar may be a great tool to help you communicate physically with them during those situations where your voice just seems to be totally ignored. The limited slip ""squeezing"" action is more humane than a standard or slip collar provides. Using a standard or slip collar with a dog on lead that constantly pulls intensely, can cause damage to their throat area over time. Martingale Collars Provide Humane Corrections While Training Your Dog Martingales are also referred to by some as limited slip, backout or no-backout collars. The main differentiating function regardless of what you call it is to allow limited-travel corrections, unlike a slip trainer or chain style choker that continues to squeeze your dog around the neck, the harder your dog pulls. Many dog trainers prefer a martingale dog collar for dogs, opposed to other style slip trainers or choke chains that can put too much pressure on your dog's throat area during corrections. Personalize Your Pup A dogIDs handcrafted martingale collar can be personalized with embroidery or laser engraving as well! If you choose a personalized style for your furry friend, enjoy the silence with no jingling dog tags. You can have your contact information laser engraved on a custom name plate or the quick release buckle. Or you can have your customized name and phone number embroidered on it to keep your dog known and safely home. No noisy jingling ID tag to worry about. A Personalized and Waterproof Option? Yes! Our Personalized Waterproof Chain Martingale is one of our most popular sellers and comes in many beautiful colors to pick from. It's odor and waterproof, personalized with an engraved name plate, provides training functionality, and is very stylish. Now that's a great all around training tool! Great Collar Design for Dogs with Small Heads and Large Necks A limited slip collar for dogs is also a great choice for dogs with small heads or smaller dogs who tend to slip out of traditional collars while on lead. They're also ideal for sight hounds, like greyhounds and whippets. Customize your pup by choosing from an assortment of styles and colors for a truly unique look. Check out our selection of other dog training collars for even more options! Here's a great video demonstrating how and why to use a martingale collar.

Each of dogIDs leather dog collars is handmade in the USA along with many matching fine leather products like leashes and dog training accessories. Don’t settle for inexpensive low quality leather - we've been making leather dog collars for a long time, know there is a huge difference and know that your dog deserves better. Choose the Right Leather Not all leather is created equal. You can trust us on that. We have always stuck with vegetable tanned leather sourced in the USA to work with, as we love the classic finished look it provides and know there are no harsh chemicals being used to produce it. Any of our English bridle leather collars are a sure bet if you are looking for the most regal looking collar with superior durability to have around your dog's neck. They are a little stiff at first, but once your dog wears it a while and it breaks in absorbing your dogs natural oils, wow, you just can't beat how classy they look and soft they feel. Artisanal Quality and Added Touch of Class Our handcrafted leather dog collars are beautiful all by themselves but we like to add subtle highllights you won't find other places, like thick, heavy-duty nylon thread that is normally only used for horse tack. We believe it adds a notch-up classy look that is very difficult to find, and you will too once you see the difference. Sizes can be custom-fit to suit any breed or dog life stage, and your canine companion is sure to stand out in the crowd with the finest and most unique leather dog collar with a stainless steel or solid brass customized name plate riveted on to keep him known and safely home. You customize the text on your dog's engraved name plate just the way you want to. Why Faux Leather Collar Options? Some may think that faux leather dog collars are a step down, like when buying a couch. Well, that's simply not the case. We've been working with waterproof strap for dog collars for decades. In fact, Clint, our founder, was one of the first in the pet industry to make dog collars with waterproof strap back in the 90s while building another business in the dog product industry. Biothane waterproof strap was originally developed for horse tack. It's a special type of poly coated synthetic webbing that is super durable and resistant to moisture, cold and UV light. Once Clint started seeing how soft, durable and similar looking to leather it was, he just had to start using it to make dog collars. If it worked much better than leather for horse team reins, why not dog collars, right? He was right and it's actually really hard to tell the difference just by looking, and it's so soft to the touch yet ridiculously strong. If your dog loves to get out there and enjoy nature, you'll much appreciate how easy our faux leather waterproof collars are to clean and maintain, with the added benefit of never having that musty, stinky smell some collars develop over time. Shop Leather Collars and Faux Leather Collars Today From personalized options to vibrant colors, our collection is the perfect mix of durability and high-end style. Explore our leather cleaning tips to keep your collar looking brand new year after year. Rest easy knowing that your personalized leather dog collars are guaranteed for the life of your pet.

So do we, which is why dogIDs is pleased to offer a variety of handmade custom reflective dog collars that ensure your dog is unmistakable, even in low light conditions. Whether you're taking your dog for a walk around the neighborhood at dusk, you're at the dog park with your pooch early in the morning watching the sun come up, or if your dog escapes from your yard when it's dark out, you want to know that people can see him or her. A reflective collar, especially when combined with a reflective leash and visi-vest, guarantees that bicyclists, drivers, and pedestrians can see your best friend whenever the smallest bit of light is shined on it. Safety First, Always for Our Dogs Dogs don't really think about safety often. There are too many squirrels to chase and holes to dig to be concerned about safety, right? That's our job to fill as pet parents. Our handmade reflective dog collars promote safety all the way around. Reflective collars from dogIDs come in an array of vivid, eye-catching colors that help to keep your dog visible even in broad daylight. At night or in poor light, a reflective strip embedded in the collar will catch streetlights, oncoming headlights, and other lights to reflect brightly. You can also personalize your pup's new reflective collar. Because dogIDs offers fully customizable collars, you can find an option that works for you and your canine companion perfectly. Embroider or laser engrave your pup's name, your name, phone number, or maybe even his or her home address on the collar. This way, people will know exactly how to get in touch with you if they find your dog wandering and looking lost. A reflective dog collar ensures that your dog is safe and visible. Don't forget to match it with one of our reflective leashes for even more high visibility for you and your best friend!

And yes, they sure do grow fast. Don't blink! Well many of our dog collars come in puppy sizes but we also make some collars specifically designed and sized for puppies, small dog breeds, cats and too many other small animals to list here. Be sure to check out our Personalized TINY Collars and TINY Collars without personization. Pretty sure you'll LOVE them. We thought it may help our puppy crazy customers some if we set this page up as a collection of all the collars we make with puppy sized options so we don't waste your time having to look through all of our other categories of dog collars to see which ones come in small enough sizes for your pup. Personalize Your Puppy Collar Our custom puppy collars are obviously very popular since puppies do grow so fast. We like to recommend going with a side release buckle style collar if your top priority is to get as much adjustment and miles out of a puppy collar as possible before graduating up to an adult collar to wear for years. But if style is top priority starting now, we've got plenty of cool collars available in puppy sizes as well with traditional style buckles. We have waterproof options for puppies who are getting into everything messy and stinky and lighter weight nylon puppy collars too. Pick a style and color you like, or two or three. Lots of options to choose from! Then, we highly recommend you consider the personalized puppy collar options or choose a custom dog tag that you can move over to new collars as your puppy grows. Puppies are little and clumsy but they can sure make tracks fast when your back is turned. Please personalize the collar with your pup's name, address, and/or at least one phone number. Having that information is imperative in case your new furry family member ever gets lost. Whoever finds your pup can get in contact with you ASAP that way. Well, they'll probably want to get their cute puppy dose and then contact you. Look for collars that you can personalize with embroidery or engraving. Spoil your puppy now and make sure they stay known and safely home! Oh, and don't forget to send us pictures! We never get enough cute puppy pictures from our customers. service@dogIDs.com .

If you're looking for a collar for dogs that holds up to the roughest conditions your pooch can throw at them, we've got some great options for you to choose from here at dogIDs. Each dogIDs collar is made with TLC before being packaged and shipped out. Many of our team members have been dog training and making dog collars with decades of experience behind them. We're very passionate about canines here, and only develop dog accessories we would also want our best friends to wear. Dog Collars for Old and Young, Big and Small, Workers and Couch Potatoes, and Everything In Between We offer a huge variety of colors, patterns, styles and sizes for puppies and teacup sized pups up to giant dog breeds, all of the highest quality. Your dog deserves the best casual and formal wear, too, right? Your best friend will be the envy of your block wearing one of a custom handcrafted product from dogIDs. And don't forget that we make collars to fit all pets. We get requests to make custom ones for cows, horses, goats, cats, rabbits, you name it, and we're always more than happy to accommodate! Some Popular Styles We Offer... Consider a nylon collar if you like quick release buckles and effortless adjustment to comfortably fit your pet's neck. The nylon webbing we use is silky smooth and much thicker than most on the market and . Coordinate colors with your furry friend's wardrobe, if you like, or pick out a cool print that reflects your pal’s personality. Opt for waterproof if rainy weather, swimming, rolling in the mud and other extreme conditions are part of your pooch's life. When it's time for cleaning, just rinse it off. Even though they're tough as a grizzly bear, they're soft and grippy like leather. A leather collar is a classy choice for your stylish pooch that will last for years. All of our leather dog collars are made with premium leather sourced in the USA for durability and a regal look that just gets better with age. Check out our martingale Collars and slip collars too! Quality and Safety are Top Priorities for Our Dogs Having a unique dog collar on your canine companion's neck provides a sense of pride. It also helps us spot our dog more easily at times, especially when at the dog park or in other crowded environments. A dogIDs reflective dog collar adds another layer of visibility for low light conditions. If you are an early morning or evening dog walker, you may want to consider a reflective collar with a little more shine for safety. In our collar production, we only use stainless steel welded D rings, so you can confidently snap dog leashes to it, even if your pooch loves to pull as hard as he or she can. There's nothing worse than a D ring breaking or bending while near traffic or other chaotic situations. A dog collar from our shop won't ever have this concern. We believe the most effective way to ensure our best friends stay ""known and safely home"" is to always have a dog collar around their neck sporting a custom dog tag or personalized name plate with your contact information clearly displayed. If your pup then happens to get lost, someone who finds him can easily read your contact info and reach out to you as soon as possible. Durable Materials Sourced in the USA dogIDs collars grow with your best friend throughout his or her life because they're extremely durable. If you want a tough dog collar that will keep up with your rough and tumble pooch, we've got your back. We only use top quality materials sourced from United States suppliers that we trust and have worked with for many years. Our winters are brutal here in North Dakota and our summers are short but intense, which provides great proving grounds for our product field-testing. You can pick out a dog collar to use every day and another for special occasions, knowing they will last for many years to come! Opt to Personalize Your Pooch Consider a personalized dog collar that provides an extra touch of class. Customize your collar design just the way you like, and then personalize it to keep your fur baby known and safely home. We offer only the best dog collars personalized with your contact information boldly displayed with an engraved name plate, ID tag or embroidery. We've been laser engraving pet tags and personalized dog collars many years and have developed proprietary processes that ensure whatever information you choose to have engraved on your pet's collar is guaranteed to stay clearly visible for the life of your pet. Again, keeping them ""known and safely home"" is our top priority. Most of our collars have personalization options, so you don't have to worry about a jingling tag that can get caught on obstacles or fall off.

Doesn't your dog deserve a cohesive look? Many of our leashes are specifically designed to match a variety of our collars, but you can always go outside the box and select contrasting pieces. It all depends on you—and your pooch, of course. Always consider your dog's attitude and personality, not to mention his or her needs. A dog who loves to swim or take walks in the rain needs a waterproof leash, for example. Leashes with Personality Our custom dog leashes are available in a rainbow of colors and just as many designs. Durable nylon, tough canvas, handsome leather—we have the best dog leash for your pup. Our soft yet tough waterproof leashes provide great grip and come in every imaginable color, so you can pick a style that’s perfect for you and your pup. Bridle leather and Italian leather are luxurious, comfortable, and long-lasting. Reflective leashes are ideal for early morning or nighttime walks. Are you dealing with walking two dogs? Try one of our double dog leashes, and take both of your pups for a stroll without getting into a tangled mess! Don’t forget to add your pup’s name and your contact information to your custom dog lead in case it ever gets misplaced. Choose to have the text of your choice embroidered directly on the leash itself or choose to have a custom engraved name plate riveted onto your new leash.

Here at dogIDs, we offer a selection of slip leashes for dogs that are durable, beautiful, and comfortable. We Have a Few Types of Slip Leashes to Choose From… Although we don’t recommend slip leashes for regular walks, they’re the only choice for serious dog trainers and handlers whose dogs take part in competitions. What’s so unique about a slip lead? It comes down to construction. Typical dog leashes have a clip that attaches to a dog's collar. Slip leashes don’t have this clip. Instead, they have a large loop that the handle slides through. This ends up creating a loose leash that tightens when the dog pulls and is relaxed when the dog heels. Many trainers also love slip leads since they are so simple and less bulky. Because they have less hardware, they can be easily slung around your neck or rolled up and put in a pocket when not in use. When you choose one of our slip leashes, you can choose from materials such as: Braided nylon rope: This material is durable, soft, and is available in a myriad of colors Waterproof: Simple light design with waterproof Biothane Beta strap, which is super strong yet soft in the hand Leather: Although leather takes longer to break in, it’s water-resistant and typically the best choice for dog shows While a slip lead may seem like a great alternative to a collar or leash, it’s not. A collar ID that can be worn daily is an essential safety item for your pup so a collar is still always a must. It’s been shown that 1 in 3 dogs who become lost never find their way home due to improper identification. So don’t forget to check out our personalized dog collars and dog tags when you buy your new slip lead! A dog tag or personalized collar is more than decoration, it’s a dog's ticket home. Custom Made and Guaranteed by dogIDs Don’t forget that dogIDs includes a guarantee with each purchase! Plus, if your total order is over the threshold, you’ll receive free shipping too.

A martingale leash works similarly to a martingale collar. It has two small loops around a big loop, and when your dog pulls, the small loops tighten which applies pressure to your dog’s neck to remind them to change their behavior. However, when your dog is at rest or loose-leash walking, the martingale leash (sometimes called a “dog show leash” or ""training leash"") will lie comfortably on their neck and provide the correct amount of control for you, the walker. Easy to Use, Easy to Love A Martingale lead is also super easy to put on and take off, especially for quick jaunts out of the house. It acts as sort of a leash and collar combo for quick trips. Simply loosen the large loop and slip it over your dog’s head. Martingale leashes are a favorite of show dog owners, dog trainers, and animal rescue volunteers for their beauty, ease, and practicality. Our martingale leads feature a leather adjustment slide that prevents your dog from slipping out of their leash during training. Don’t Forget the Collar! For quick trips and short walks, martingale leads are a great option, but they are no substitute for a dog collar. We would still recommend outfitting your dog with a personalized dog collar that they can wear all of the time in case they get away and need to be returned home. Having your contact information laser engraved on the collar itself is the best way to make sure that your dog can be easily returned back to you.

Let’s face it, we’ve all been there before, and a rain-soaked walk isn’t ideal. Yet, despite the storm, you can make your jaunt into the rain more pleasant when you use one of the waterproof dog leashes we hand craft at dogIDs. Not only do they still maintain their grip when wet and do not get water logged but they also don't get that musty odor from being wet and resist all odors. Waterproof and odor proof leashes, now that's a big benefit. And even though these leashes are super tough and moisture proof, they also have a soft texture so they are very comfortable in your hand and easy to grip. No need to worry about burns or cuts when your dog gets a little rambunctious and pulls as hard as they can. Rain, Rain, Go Away…Or Not Waterproof leashes are more important than you may think. Have you considered that a waterproof dog leash is: Easier to grip: Because the leash isn’t waterlogged, it’s easier to keep a firm grip on the leash and, in turn, your pup too. Resistant to odor: Because your leash isn’t going to get waterlogged, it will be much more resistant to sour smells over time. More hygienic: A waterproof leash is also resistant to mold, which grows much more easily on a wet leash. Waterproof leashes are also a perfect choice for your water-loving pup who loves splashing about in the lake or ocean. You won’t have to worry about waiting for your dog’s leash to dry in between uses! Our waterproof dog leashes pair well with our waterproof dog collars, so don’t be afraid to grab a matching set. And don’t forget: select orders receive free shipping! You Can Put Your Trust in dogIDs for Quality Since 2005, we at dogIDs have been satisfying customers with our unique blend of high-quality products and excellent customer service.

With proper care, leather is an extremely durable, comfortable, and stylish choice for your dog’s leash. Choose from our extensive selection of leather dog leashes and upgrade the look with signature personalization options to truly make it your own! Personalized Leather Dog Leashes When people think of leather, they often think of a material that can be stiff and unforgiving. Granted, like a baseball glove, a leather leash needs time to break in. However, very quickly you’ll find that a leather leash will turn buttery smooth and soft. At dogIDs we offer two different leather leash options to maximize your choices: Faux Leather: Waterproof and odor proof but looks like leather, and much easier to clean. English Bridle Leather: Extremely durable and extremely classy looking at the same time. You can customize our leash options with your own personalized message or your dog’s information. Best of all, each of our leashes comes with a guarantee. At dogIDs, We Have It All Since 2005, dogIDs has been selling high-quality leather dog leashes to our customers. However, we sell so much more than leashes. We’re also your best option for dog tags, dog collars, harnesses, and supplies as well. Whatever you need, we’ll have what you’re looking for!

Shop our selection of custom handmade service dog harnesses and you’ll see that we have quite a few options for service dog harnesses, from a heavy duty harness with custom patch to an embroidered harness with the service dog job embroidered directly on it. From colorful to simple, you can be sure that everyone around you will know what your dog is focused on, which will help your dog do their work more efficiently. Leashes Want a non-traditional way to alert those around you as to your dog’s service dog status? Try out an embroidered leash.

It's also the most important thing you can do for your dog when it comes to safety. Keeping your dog known and safely home is critical and our top priority here at dogIDs is dog identification. Let your creativity flow while exploring our dog collar styles and build your furry friend's new favorite forever collar! A personalized dog collar with personal contact info is hands down the most effective and practical solution to ensure your dog is easily identified and safely returned home if ever lost. A collar with a name and phone number boldly displayed right on the collar improves the odds of someone finding your contact information easily and returning your dog home as swiftly as possible. Importance of Dog Collars Personalized for Identification It's Not Always Easy Identifying a Lost Dog Reading a dog's ID tag when they're lost isn't always an easy task. Often a stray dog is very anxious about being lost and very excited to see a new human at the same time! This can make finding a family phone number challenging. Some people are intimidated by a strange dog and would rather not risk getting bit or slobbered on while trying to find contact information on a pet tag under the dog's jowls in order to call his or her family. A personalized dog collar with your name and phone number engraved on a name plate or embroidered on the collar strap is much easier to notice and read while standing near an anxious lost dog. Personalized Collars for Dogs Make Identification Easier If your dog is wearing a personalized dog collar, it's much easier for a finder to read your contact information and reach out to you, most of the time without the need to even physically touch your dog. Our ScruffTag Collar improves the dog identification process even more by ensuring the personalized name plate always sits right on the back of your dog's neck, or ""scruff"", making it even easier for someone who finds your lost pup to read your contact information and call you ASAP. The ScruffTag is also built into the structure of the collar, so it's impossible for it to ever fall off. Hanging dog tags are also a great method to identify dogs and have been used for decades successfully. Pet tags can also be easily moved or replaced and are super fun for accessorizing . But tags can become hard to read sometimes, and tags can fall off or get caught on obstacles now and then. This isn't a risk with a collar that has an engraved name plate, engraved buckle or embroidered collar strap. Personalized collars are a step-up when considering practicality and safety. A Dog Collar with ID Can't Be Substituted Microchipping is an excellent layer of protection, but not a guarantee to get your dog home if they happen to wander. Microchips must be scanned with proprietary scanning devices usually only found at veterinary clinics or animal shelters. So even if your canine companion is microchipped, please make sure he or she is also ALWAYS wearing a dog ID tag or a collar with your name and contact information as visible as possible for someone trying to help them get home. There are many dog tracking devices on the market too. They work great for monitoring a dog's whereabouts and activities and can also be very effective tools to help a dog get home. However, batteries go dead, the devices can be bulky for your dog and most are dependent on Wi-Fi or cell phone service, which is not always dependable. Also keep in mind, not everyone is tech-savvy, especially when out in the woods or some other remote location away from their normal technology tools. Physical identification still must also be on a dog, even if your dog wears an electronic tracking device. Create a Unique Engraved Dog Collar Design a Unique Personalized Pet Collar We make many styles of great looking personalized custom dog collars that are tough as nails and super comfortable for a dog to wear! We have so many options to choose from and just know you'll enjoy designing yours just the way you want. With so many collars for dogs on the market, it can be difficult to choose the best one that truly complements your pet’s color, size, breed and personality. At dogIDs we know that every dog is unique, so we strive to offer the most customization options possible, so you can align your custom collar design with your best friend perfectly. From giant breeds to minis, and all dog shapes, sizes and activities between, we’re here to help you choose the perfect personalized collar for your pup. What Information Should Be Put On Engraved Dog Collars? Well, this is a very common question we get and a very important one at that. Personalized collars are pawesome! But choosing what to have engraved or embroidered on a collar can be a difficult choice since you have a limited amount of space to work with for personalization on a collar strap, buckle or name plate. We recommend phone numbers for sure. One is great, but multiple phone numbers is always better. Name, address, city, state, etc. are nice to include, but phone numbers are definitely most important. You want the person that finds your dog to be able to contact you ASAP, and phone numbers are still the most effective means to get in touch with a pet parent. A last name may be helpful too at times. If you live in a community where everyone knows everyone, sometimes a familiar family name helps to get the right people in the dog-return process. Should I Put My Name or My Dog's Name On the Collar? Oh boy, now we're opening a can of worms that can cause heated debate. We won't go there, but we will tell you the arguments of both sides and let you choose. First view: If you put the dog's name on an ID tag or collar, people will be able to gain the dog's trust and more easily steal them. Second view: If you put the dog's name on an ID tag or collar, the dog will feel less stressed if they hear the finder using their name. We all like familiar, right? So do dogs. It's personal preference. Our default answer to people is to put your family's last name and as many phone numbers as you can on the ID tag or collar. About dogIDs Collars Our Most Popular Styles... Waterproof: To suit the dog who lives for lake swims and getting muddy whenever possible. If your dog is adventurous and always seems to get into the messiest and stinkiest things, you should consider a waterproof dog collar for your trailblazing pooch. Our waterproof dog collars are easy to clean and will make life easier for you...And never stink. Martingales: Looking for the most humane training collar option? Try one of our martingale collars to help communicate effectively with your dog when they need corrections. A martingale dog collar is preferred by many dog trainers with good reason. Reflective: A reflective dog collar is for the dawn and dusk walker. Perfect for midnight or early-morning walks. Reflective dog collars add another layer of safety for low light conditions to help keep you and your pooch safe. A reflective dog collar will also help your dog stay safe when you aren't with them as they make your dog much more visible when in headlights. Leather & Faux Leather: Our leather dog collars and faux leather collars are perfect for those who love the looks of a classic leather dog collar with a name plate riveted on. We also have them without name plates if you already have a dog ID tag you want to use instead. There's just something about a good old personalized leather dog collar though. They look so classic and regal. Nylon: Nylon or polypropylene (poly pro) webbing collars are great for those who prefer a super-soft and lighter weight collar with a quick release buckle. We make these collars with silky smooth yet extremely durable, thick nylon webbing and stitch them with heavy-duty nylon thread. Have personal contact info either embroidered on the strap or laser engraved on the buckle or name plate. Regardless of personalization preference, the side release buckle makes putting on and taking off easy. Designer: If uniqueness is your top priority, take a look at our designer dog collar collection. Designer collars generally have multicolor designs, woven patterns and unique accents. We put a little extra unique styling into these collars. Our Commitment to Quality You can rest assured that a custom dog collar from dogIDs will be extremely durable and handcrafted just the way you want, with style, safety and comfort in mind. Almost every dog collar from dogIDs can be laser engraved, embroidered or paired with a traditional dog tag deeply engraved with the latest laser technology in-house. We lifetime guarantee every dog collar we sell to ensure you that won’t have to worry about replacing them over and over to keep them easily readable. Rest easy knowing your best friend's collar will always keep them known and safely home. Why Are dogIDs Collars the Best? We make extremely durable yet practical, comfortable, customizable dog collars, utilizing only the highest quality USA-sourced materials and the latest personalization technology. This ensures years of durability, safety and comfort. Once you have one of our collars in-hand, you'll definitely notice the difference. Only the best for your best friend. We don't just talk the talk, we walk it. We recognize the importance of paying close attention to the details and quality of every dog collar we make. No corner-cutting or cheap laser marking happens in our shop. We know the difference and have the right equipment, experience and skilled pack members to build high quality custom collars for dogs with highly visible and long-lasting identification. We go the extra mile when it comes to embroidering and laser engraving. For an embroidered dog collar, we use high stitch count heavy-duty nylon thread to produce bold, long-lasting embroidery. When it comes to laser engraving, we push our lasers to the max to make sure our engraving goes deep and lasts forever. Are dogIDs Collars Really Handmade? It may disappoint some people that we don't use huge extravagant assembly equipment and robots, but yes, every dog collar, leash and harness we produce is handmade by our pack members in our shop at dogIDs. In fact, if it's during the day when you're reading this, odds are one of our team members is using a hammer and cutting dies to cut strap and adjusting holes or hand assembling a newly customized dog collar for some lucky pup. dogIDs Roots Back in the mid 90s Clint, the Founder of dogIDs, looked high and low for dog collars and custom training accessories that were the highest quality and had that special look he wanted for his working dogs. They were nowhere to be found. Fortunately, he finally found Steve Vollmer, a local draft horse harness maker from Brainerd, MN that still used old world technology to handcraft exquisite leather horse harnesses, saddles and other custom leather horse products for companies and individuals all over the world. It just so happened that Steve also loved dogs and the art of making dog collars, leashes and dog training accessories. Finally, someone that knew how to make a leather dog collar that met his expectations! Needless to say, Clint and Steve hit it off as friends very quickly. Old World Collar Making Practices Carried On Clint decided to work alongside Steve in his shop for a while and learn some things about the craft that Steve mastered but was very difficult to find anywhere in the modern world. He learned many tricks of the trade along the way. No, no crazy high-tech equipment but just plain common sense and passion driven skills needed to make custom dog collars and leashes that look great, function well, last forever and convince you when you have one in-hand, that it's a quality substantial product. The practices Clint learned are still integrated into our processes here at dogIDs and are still evident in the products we produce today. You may find a personalized dog collar or three out there that look similar to ours, but they won't have the subtle little differentiators that only we know how to create. Wisdom can only come from experience and can't be copied. You'll just have to trust us on that. We're Here to Help You Create That Perfect Custom Collar Contact our expert team for help with any sizing, customization or other questions regarding any of our dog collars. Just let us know what you're looking to create. We'll help you narrow down the options and design that perfectly personalized custom dog collar you and your best friend need.

Hence, our tags are guaranteed for life. The high power lasers we utilize and the wisdom we've gained from many years of dog tag customization helps us keep pets ""known and safely home"", and looking classy at the same time. Personalize your pets! Replacing dog tags frequently because your contact info wears off gets annoying...and expensive. That isn't a concern with ours at dogIDs. Once you see one of ours on your pup's collar and realize how long it lasts, we're quite confident you'll agree that we produce the best looking and longest lasting dog tags on the market. Check out the products above for more information! Personalized Dog ID Tags Are Still a Necessity Technology is rapidly advancing, but we still have the same issue...Dogs can't talk. Hence, dog ID tags are a necessity. Yes, tracking them with the latest high-tech tracking collar helps us keep tabs on them, but batteries go dead, and Wi-Fi and cell phone signals aren't always reliable. Most people who find a lost dog still prefer to look for a dog ID tag with a phone number to call immediately rather than go through additional technology steps. And let's face it, not everyone is tech-savvy. A personalized collar or pet tag is still the most reliable way to keep your pet known and safely home. Our Dog Tags Aren't Just for Dogs Let's get something straight. Just because our company name has ""dog"" in it, doesn't mean we only make ID tags for dogs. Oh no, we make them for animals of all shapes and sizes. Cats, horses, goats, cows, ferrets, you name it. We even make them for people too! Making personalized dog tags, dog collars and personalized pet accessories has been our core business over the years. We like to apply that same wisdom we've gained to all pets whenever we get the opportunity. Many pet parents also like to use our name plates and ID tags for: Leashes Kennels Harnesses Food Bags Travel Pet Carriers Other pet accessories Our dog tags can be put on pretty much anything you want to keep track of that you can attach a split ring or S-hook to. Always Have Backup Tags On Hand Still have “Dog ID tags” on your checklist? While you're checking the box off of your list, we recommend taking advantage of our discounts for multiple dog tags. Our quantity discounts are listed on all of our pet ID tag product pages. If you buy 2 or more dog tags, we automatically discount the price of each tag by 25% in your cart! It's good to always have backup tags on-hand for your pooch in case you get a new collar, or he happens to lose his name tag. We don't know how they do it, but it seems if they find a way to lose their dog tags, they will, and sometimes even repeatedly. It's also a good idea to have multiple tags if you travel to different locations like a weekend cottage. You never know when your pet will decide to go on a solo adventure so having IDs with contact information for wherever you travel is always a good practice. If you foster or dog sit, you may want to have a few extra ID tags on hand for new canine clients staying with you as well. That way, if the dog you're watching gets lost, the finder will call your phone number for a more swift return. Huge Selection of Pet ID Tag Designs to Choose From We have lots of options to help you create a perfect personalized ID for your pooch. Our dog tags for pets are available in several colors, shapes, and sizes. If you prefer the classic dog tag look, we carry brass dog tags, which aren't as easy to find as they used to be. Unique Dog Tag Collections with Hundreds of Designs While you're browsing our hundreds of unique dog ID tag designs, make sure to check out our Themed Dog Tag Collections too. You'll find many designs to pick from in each collection once you get to its product information page. Some of our Themed Tag Collections have dozens and dozens of designs to choose from. Choose from: Dog ID tags with a dog breed design State designs representing where you’re from A hobby related design And more! If you don't see one that you believe will be the perfect design for your pup, contact us so we can help you get a custom tag order started. What Information Should You Put On Your Custom Dog Tags? No matter which style ID tags you prefer for your pet, we highly recommend including at least one phone number when deciding on what personal contact information to have engraved on your pet's name tag. Two or three phone numbers is even better. Other information you might include is: Any medical conditions Whether your pet needs medication Your pet’s name Your last name We also have medical alert tags that add extra awareness to whatever health condition people need to know about. Are Double-Sided Custom Pet Tags Better Than One-Sided? Yes, the more contact information on a pet tag, the better. Even if it seems you only need a dog name tag with one side engraved and the other side blank, we recommend considering a tag with both sides engraved, so you can include as much contact information as possible on the ID. Even if it's just a name on one side, that frees up space for contact information on the other side of your tag. Is My Dog's ID Lifetime Guaranteed? Seriously? Yes! Every dog ID tag we produce is laser engraved deeply and comes with a lifetime guarantee. And yes, they're made in the USA , right here in Fargo, North Dakota. If you find any part of our workmanship to be unsatisfactory, we'll replace your pet ID at no cost to you. What If My Dog Loses His Tag? We always joke in our office, ""If you ever want to thoroughly test or break a product, just put it on a dog."" Dogs put products through extreme conditions, and sometimes they lose their dog tags. If this happens, just contact us. We'll look up your latest order to help you duplicate your dog's lost tag and get it shipped out to you as soon as possible. Dog Name Tags with Flat Rate Shipping and Tracking Our flat-rate shipping ensures no shipping fee surprises when you check out, and you'll receive a tracking number when your order ships. Your dog's ID will arrive on time and in mint condition, ready to wear with the necessary attachment hardware. We utilize USPS for shipping dog tags and always provide you with a tracking number for your shipment. You can relax knowing that dogIDs takes your pet's safety seriously from the moment we start producing your dog's IDs, until you receive them. ""Only the Best for Your Best Friend"" is one of our taglines with good reason. We don't just talk quality here at dogIDs, we walk it.

We understand that a high quality dog leash is one of the best investments you can make in your dog and the relationship between the two of you. It's the most important communication tool in your arsenal of dog supplies. We have styles for all situations you and your dog may encounter, from leisurely walks to serious training situations in the field. We have every style custom dog lead you'll need and we're very confident you'll agree that choosing one of ours was the best choice you could have made. We don't just make them, we walk and train our dogs our dogs with them as well. So of course we believe without a doubt that we make the best out there. Styles, Materials and Colors to Fit All Needs Take your time browsing. We're sure you'll find just what you were looking for and then some. Here are our most popular categories to get you started: Waterproof: A waterproof lead is a must-have for dogs who love romping in lakes, pools, rivers, or the ocean. The waterproof and odor resistant strap we use is made by Biothane and was originally developed for horse team harnesses, so it's extremely heavy-duty. You'll have to look pretty close to tell it apart from leather too because of it's unique texture. Though it's tough and waterproof, you'll be amazed how soft and grippy it feels in-hand. Nylon: Nylon is a very popular leash material so you can find them everywhere. Not a leash like ours though. We've spent many years finding a heavy-duty, thick nylon webbing that is silky smooth and feels so nice in your hands. Prefer a lightweight lead? This is a good choice for you. Rope: Many people love to use a rope lead as the round shape feels so naturally comfortable in your hands. You'll love ours as they're made with a very soft polypro rope, which has a super soft feel! They also easily roll up and stow away in the smallest spaces without getting bent out of shape. Leather: If you try a leather lead from dogIDs, we're quite confident it will eventually be your favorite to walk your canine companion with. All of our leather leads are top grade leather, mainly English bridle leather. Once they break in, they're so supple. They feel so good in-hand and look so classy. Add a personalized name plate and wow, they really look sharp! Reflective: Reflective dog leashes can make a huge difference when walking your dog in low-light conditions. The large surface area of reflectivity helps make you and your dog much more visible for safety. Specialty: If you're looking for a leash with special functionality, check out our specialty leads collection. From steady tabs to check cords, we've got all the bases covered, especially if you're into dog training. What Length Dog Leash Do I Need? This mainly depends on your height, the height of your dog and how much extra length you want to work with. It also depends on the most common situations you find you and your pooch in when out and about. If you're frequently walking in congested environments or with lots of traffic, a traffic lead with a shorter handle may be a good option since this lead requires a dog to be right beside you in heel position. Otherwise, a 4 or 6 foot length is most popular and can accommodate most leisure walk situations. If you'd like a lead that has multiple functions to train with and go for dog walks, you may want to try either our leather or waterproof jaeger lead. Which is the Best Dog Leash for Walks? This question is very subjective and mainly depends on what your needs are. However, most seasoned dog trainers recommend a 6 foot leash, especially to train with, so you always have some extra length to work with when needed. If you then have a lot of slack in the lead, you can just grab the excess with your other hand or roll it up around your lead hand when not needed. That way if you want to let your pup sniff the latest marks on trees or say hi to his familiar neighborhood friends, you don't have to try to cover the ground that he can. Specialty Dog Leads To Get the Job Done Do you walk multiple dogs at the same time? Snag yourself one of our double-dog or multi-leashes that resist twisting. Many of our leashes can be personalized with your contact information too in case you ever misplace it or want to label them. We make many types of specialty leads like jaeger leads, traffic leads, steady tabs, long lines, or as some call them in the sporting dog world, check cords, and other leashes you need for those special situations. Working dog handlers love our specialty leash collection! Once you pick out one of our custom dog leashes, you can select the color and customization if you want and add a unique dog tag or matching collar too.

We utilize a special extra thick type of Biothane strap, which is ridiculously durable yet soft to the touch, to make these Faux Leather Collars - Waterproof and odor proof, so your dog can be the adventurous dog he is without you having to worry about his collar getting soaked, dirty and stinky like leather and nylon collars tend to! A vegan friendly dog collar that's tough as nails? Yep, and just as classy looking as traditional leather dog collars too. Right before River, our ""Spokesdog"" passed away, our Founder, Clint, made one of these collars for River in dark brown with stainless steel hardware to celebrate his last days. It was definitely River's and Clint's favorite collar that River has ever worn. We fully stitch the perimeter of these collars with thick ivory colored heavy-duty nylon thread as an accent to make sure it looks classy like a traditional leather collar and lasts forever. Nylon thread is incredibly durable and used for horse tack regularly for durability. We don't cut corners on hardware either. You have the choice of either solid brass or stainless steel hardware. No cheap nickel or brass plated zinc hardware here to cut corners and increase profit! Only the best for your best friend and these collars will turn heads because of it. The Advantages of Biothane Our BioThane products have been a favorite among dog lovers for years, they're a top pick for a variety of reasons. The fact that they’re waterproof, odor-proof and super easy to clean ranks high on the list. No matter how much your pooch frolics in the water, it won't damage the collar, nor will the water affect the Biothane strap’s durability or structure. Plus, no need to worry about smelly odors! The Biothane strap we use is the thickest they make giving it an extra soft feel. So don't be disappointed when buying Biothane collars from other makers saving cost. There's a huge difference that you'll instantly feel. This strap was originally designed for horse team harnesses so you can be very confident it will hold up no matter what your dog throws at it. If horses can tow with it, I'm sure you'll agree that it's strong enough for the rowdiest of dogs. The Importance of Having Current ID on Your Dog's Collar It’s crucial you update your identification when adding a new dog to the family to help make sure they return home safely if they ever go wandering. With these Waterproof Faux Leather ScruffTag Collars, you can add your personalized contact information on the nameplate for no additional charge. This is the place to put your doggo’s name, contact info, and important medical alerts, if any. You will have one line for your dog’s name, and three lines for any important contact information or care instructions you would like to include.

The nylon webbing we make these collars with is thick, tough and so silky smooth, with many colors to choose from.

Our Waterproof Standard Collar with Name Plate is perfect for just those reasons! Made of Biothane waterproof and odor proof strap and top quality hardware, it's the perfect balance of everything you look for in a personalized waterproof dog collar. The riveted on name plate is laser engraved just how you want it, and since it's riveted to the collar securely, you won't have to worry about it getting caught on things or making that jingling noise every time your dog makes a move. Made With Durability in Mind If you are looking for a material that will withstand anything your dog can throw at it, Soft Grip is the perfect choice. This incredible material is waterproof, odor-proof, and made to withstand harsh climate conditions such as extreme cold. Not only is this waterproof dog collar with nameplate going to last, but it is also comfortable for your furry friend. The material is soft to the touch and the leather-like texture adds more grip. These characteristics along with the stainless steel D-Ring and heavy-duty rivets make these personalized waterproof dog collars an excellent choice for dogs who love to swim, puddle jump, or roll in the mud! Due to the current metal shortage, all other hardware is nickel plated. Personalized Look One of the most important aspects of having a collar on your dog is ensuring that emergency information is available to others if something happens. Without a collar, your chances of getting your dog back if they run away become much lower. Here at dogIDs, we offer many different customization options for our personalized waterproof dog collars so you can always have the information you need looking exactly how you want it to look. With the ability to add 3 rows of text with up to 15 characters each, you have plenty of room to say whatever you’d like. Include information such as names and phone numbers to make sure your dog is identifiable in case of an emergency. With a collar from dogIDs, you will never have to worry about a fading name-tag again. We use high-power laser engraving that vaporizes the material, leaving you with a tag that is easy to read and guaranteed for the lifetime of your pet. Bundle With Matching Leash!

If you’re new to the dog world, you might be confused when it comes to choosing the right one for your new canine family member. There are so many options, brands, designs and materials - How could you possibly choose the best one, especially a custom collar for your dog? Every dog is a little bit different in what they need. The best way to pick the right collar for your pooch is by breaking it down into the different qualities you need.Step 1: Choose a Collar Style We’d recommend first deciding which overall type of collar you prefer and/or fits the majority of your needs. You need to decide early on what you want the collar to do for your dog. Are you going to be using it for everyday wear and identification? Training? Walking? Does your dog have collar style requirements for the dog park, doggy day care, etc? Here’s a basic breakdown of the main types of dog collars you can choose from: Traditional Buckle Dog Collar This is a dog collar with a prong style buckle and collar strap with holes punched in it for adjustment. Think of it as a human belt buckle. This style buckle works well for dogs that wear their collars continuously as these buckles are a bit harder to undo regularly. They are commonly found on leather dog collars. Quick Release Buckle Dog Collar This type of collar comes with a plastic or metal buckle that has female and male buckle ends that clasp together. Generally, the buckle will hold tightly when it’s being pulled on, but when the side latches are pressed with your fingers, the latch mechanism disengages allowing the collar to be removed easily from your dog’s neck. A quick release buckle collar is sometimes required at certain boarding and doggy day care facilities because it makes it easy to remove a dog’s collar if they were to get it caught on something or get caught up in any type of chaotic situation requiring quick removal. In the cat world, there is a variation of this buckle for cat collars called a breakaway buckle collar. A breakaway buckle unlatches if enough pulling force is applied to the collar or latch. If the collar gets stuck on something and your pet tries to pull away, the latch will release and the collar will fall away, freeing them much more easily. While we do recommend this for cat collars, we don’t recommend breakaway buckles for dogs often. When dogs put pressure on their collars while on a leash or tie-out, the collar coming off could put the dog in serious danger. Safety or Center Ring Collar This type of collar is common for hunting dogs and other working dogs that are routinely navigating through rugged terrain and obstacles or dogs that have a larger area to roam where they could possibly get stuck on something like a fence or tree branch. A safety collar has an O-shaped ring built into the collar about halfway between each end. This O-ring provides a pivot point for the collar straps so it doesn’t twist and squeeze your dog’s neck and the pivot point also allows your dog to slip out of the collar more easily if stuck on something. That way, if your dog gets their collar stuck on something, the collar won’t choke them and they can more likely slip out of the collar. You can learn more about the safety collar here. Martingale Collar A martingale dog collar is perfect for dogs that back out of their collars often or need correction during training sessions. When walking, it gives the pet parent a bit more control over your dog. Martingales are a great alternative to slip or “choke” collars as the amount of cinch is limited and is applied more evenly around your dog’s neck. This means martingale collars are much less likely to cause harm to your dog’s trachea when your dog is pulling compared to a slip collar. Martingales also can actually give your dog a sense of calmness since they apply a moderate even pressure around your dog’s neck when pulled on, kind of like a security blanket if you will. Learn more about martingale collars and how they are used here. ScruffTag Collar The ScruffTag collar design is unique to dogIDs specifically. It was developed by our founder, Clint. On any of our custom handmade ScruffTag Collars, the straps of the collar are built into a large rectangular ID tag. This way, the personalization that is engraved onto the ScruffTag name plate always rests on the back of the dog’s neck instead of hanging below their mouth. If your dog gets lost and a stranger finds them, they can easily read the the large deeply engraved contact information engraved on the ScruffTag needed to return your pet to you, most of the time without even physically contacting your dog to read it. Some people are intimidated to reach under a dog’s jowls to find a pet ID tag or personalized collar buckle for fear of being bitten or drooled on so ScruffTag Collars eliminate that variable, increasing the odds of the finder contacting you and returning your dog. Additionally, our custom ScruffTag collars can be made with different types of buckles and materials so that you can design it just the way you want. Custom Dog Harness While technically this is not a type of dog collar, this is totally an option to consider for your furry friend. If you have a dog that is a strong puller or has a delicate neck, a harness is a great alternative for walking. By putting the pressure of the leash clip on the dog’s body/chest instead of their neck, it’s much easier to control them and avoid injury.Step 2: Choose a Dog Collar Material Now that you’ve narrowed down what you need for a collar style, it’s time to think about the material you’d like your collar to be made out of. You may be looking for a collar purely for looks or you might be looking for durability. Your dog may have sensitive skin, so you need something that won’t exacerbate that issue. Here’s a breakdown of the different collar materials you can pick from: Nylon Webbing Collar Nylon webbing is one of the most common materials dog collars are made with. It’s usually less expensive and gives you a lot of options for colors and designs. It’s also pliable, so a great option for smaller dogs or dogs with more sensitive coats. The nylon webbing we use at dogIDs is a proprietary blend that feels silky soft and is quite thick compared to other nylon colors on the market. It took us years of trial and error to find the nylon webbing that we love and trust and once you hold a nylon dogIDs collar in your hand, you’ll definitely feel the difference. However, nylon is not the perfect material for every dog. If you have a dog that spends a lot of time outside or gets wet all the time, nylon collars can get pretty dirty and stinky over time. They also don’t usually last as long as other sturdier materials like waterproof Biothane strap or leather. If you like the idea of nylon, but your dog has nylon allergies, we also have polypropylene webbing or braided rope collars. Our polypropylene webbing collars have a grosgrain ribbon sewn on the outside of them, which is usually embroidered with your personalized contact information so that’s the best way to identify them while browsing our online store. Waterproof Biothane or Soft Grip Collar This urethane and vinyl coated polyester webbing looks and feels very similar to leather with several added benefits. Not only does it look great and come in tons of colors and patterns (even reflective), but it is incredibly durable. It can hold up to water, smells and extreme temperature changes, making it a dog owner favorite. Don’t be fooled by the knockoffs (we’ve tried them all and they don’t hold up as well). And keep in mind that we’ve been working with Biothane strap since the late 90’s. Through many years of field testing, we’ve determined the best variations of Biothane strap to make our collars and leashes with, which we call Soft Grip. Biothane makes hundreds of variations of waterproof strap. We use a super heavy version. Yes, it’s more expensive than the Biothane strap most of our competitors use but it’s substantially thicker, heavier duty, and since it’s thicker, it has a very nice soft feel to it when you grip it…Hence “Soft Grip”. This heavy duty strap also stands up to extreme temperatures and UV light much better which adds years of use without cracking or fading. This material is a great fit for active dogs, especially water-loving breeds and those pups that love to roll in the stinkiest things they can find. It can hold up to pretty much anything your dog can throw at it! Plus, it comes in variations that have reflective strips built right into the collar strap for added safety. Leather Dog Collar Leather is the traditional material type for dog collars. There’s something very elegant and classic about a dog wearing a leather dog collar. That being said, leather is not just for looks! Because of the way our leathers tanned and made for dog collars, they have some additional protection from the elements…are extremely durable. Our leathers also soften over time and exposure to your dog’s natural oils. We carry a few varieties of leather material types, including English bridle leather and padded leather custom dog collars. And yes, they are handmade in the USA, including the leathers they are cut from. The bridle leather collars are a better match for larger breed dogs with active lifestyles while the padded collars work great for dogs with sensitive skin or really long necks.Step 3: Personalize Your Dog’s New Collar At dogIDs, we want to increase the number of dogs that get returned home. The best way to do this is to make sure that no matter which style of collar you pick, you personalize the collar with your most important contact information. Whether your dog's collar is engraved or embroidered, it’s important that your dog carries your contact information on them at all times so they stay known and safely home! Personalized dog collars are our specialty at dogIDs and we've been making them for decades. Want more information about dogIDs collars? Check out these other articles on our blog.

The martingale collar is a good choice for a variety of dogs because it gives you a little more control than a regular collar. Plus, it has some safety benefits. It’s my go-to collar for when I’m fostering a dog. This post goes over some of the details on why I like using martingale collars. What is a martingale collar? Martingale collars fit loosely on a dog’s neck but tighten only a limited amount when the handler makes a leash correction or the dog pulls. It has two loops. The first looks like a traditional nylon collar that is adjustable and hangs around the dog’s neck. The second is for control when the leash is attached. When the dog pulls, the collar tightens and will stay snug around the dog’s neck without choking the dog. When the tension is released, the collar loosens again.Reasons to use a martingale collar 1. The martingale collar makes it difficult for a dog to slip free. Some dogs can slip out of their collars easier than others, depending on their fur texture and the shape of their neck compared to their head. If your dog has ever slipped out of or backed out of his collar, you may want to think about getting a martingale collar for safety reasons. Martingale collars are especially safe for dogs with narrower heads such as whippets, shelties and greyhounds, as these dogs often have an easier time slipping out of a regular collar.2. Martingale collars are helpful for training. The martingale collar tightens slightly if the dog pulls on the leash, but not so much where it will choke the dog or harm his neck in any way. If you prefer to give your dog slight tugs on the leash while working on leash manners, the martingale is a nice option. Dogs that are still learning good leash manners are also more likely to pull or try to twist out of their collars when they see other dogs and other distractions. As mentioned above, the martingale collar is a good tool to prevent your dog from slipping out of his collar. 3. They're gentler than a choke collar or prong collar. The martingale collar allows you to give slight corrections if you’d like, but it is much gentler than a choke (or slip) collar or a prong/pinch collar. This makes it a nice option for a variety of dogs, even puppies or senior dogs.4. They're stylish. Martingale collars come in all sorts of colors so you can find the right style for your unique dog. For example, dogIDs carries a chain martingale collar that is made with our silky smooth heavy-duty nylon material for the main collar strap and a steel chain for the second loop. If you prefer an option that's all nylon, check out our embroidered nylon martingale option. We also offer a new waterproof chain martingale collar with personalized name plate, which works great when training a dog that loves the water.Do any of you use a martingale collar for your dog?

This question deserves a good explanation. Dog ID tags are important, and putting the right information on them is vital. Continue reading to explore what you should put on your dog’s ID tags.The Information To Put on the ID TagAn ID tag provides crucial information regarding your dog. Keep in mind that these tags are small with limited space, so filling them with the proper information is important. The first things to add are the pet’s name and your phone number. That way, someone can contact you if your dog is found after going missing. Include any of your dog’s medical needs on the tags. Getting your pup microchipped is an excellent idea; you can also put that information on the ID tag. Personal messages like “I’m friendly” or “Call my parents” are excellent additions. It can make the reuniting process faster!Use the most important information from the above ideas to create personalized dog tags. For example, if your dog requires medical attention, you should consider an ID tag layout similar to “dog’s name, your phone number, and medical attention required.” Dog ID Tag BenefitsDog ID tags are inexpensive, and there are plenty of options. Opt for the basic aluminum option, or go with something stylish like a personalized dog collar. Custom dog collars are great because the ID tags don’t dangle off a clip, and they’re not noisy. Keep in mind that the fancier the tag, the greater the price. Another benefit of ID tags is that they’re completely customizable. The information on the tag will affect how someone cares for your pup until they reunite with you. Customize additional ID tags for when you go on trips with your dog. If something happens to your dog while you’re away, the tag will display the correct information. You won’t need to worry about the tag being illegible. Anyone can decipher the information and get your dog back to you promptly. Closing ThoughtsEnsure you update the tag’s information if you get a new phone number. The last thing you need is for your dog to get lost with an ID that contains outdated information. Plenty of options exist, so take your time finding the right tags for you and your pup. Once you pick out the tag, follow the above advice to ensure you put the right information on your dog's ID tag. The only thing left is loving your dog unconditionally.Check out our personalized dog tags here!

The measurement of your dog’s neck is the size of the collar it needs. No guesswork needed to buy a collar that fits your dog correctly and comfortably.For example, if you measure your dog’s neck and get 16”, you should pick a 16” collar OR a collar where 16” is comfortably within the size range. Each collar will have adjustment holes above and below the middle one, so you will also get 1-2 inches of extra adjustment in either direction. Simply measure your dog’s neck for the proper collar size. There should always be enough room between the pet’s neck and the collar to slip one finger between them comfortably. This ensures that the collar isn't too tight. Here are a few different methods for measuring your dog's neck: Measure your dog's neck with a sewing tape. or Wrap a string around your dogs neck. Mark the string and then measure the length of it with a ruler or tape measure. or Remove your dog's current collar and stretch it out flat. Then measure from the center of the buckle to the current sizing hole or adjustment being used. In between sizes? If your dog is full grown and their measurement is in between the sizes listed, pick the smaller of the two sizes. That way, you won't have extra material hanging off of the end of the collar. If your dog is still growing, go with the larger option. A couple of other things to consider would be if your dog noticeably gains or loses weight during different seasons or if your dog has a lot of fur around their neck. For example, your dog's neck measurement may change after a haircut, during hunting season or summer months when they do a lot of swimming. If the collar has a size range, we recommend choosing the size range where your measurement is close to the middle of the sizes so you have room to adjust up and down. How To Measure Your Dog's Girth A variety of dog products, including harnesses and coats may be sized using a dog's girth. To determine your dog's girth, use a sewing tape or string to measure behind your dog's front legs to get their chest circumference. You should be measuring around your dog's rib cage about an inch or two behind the front legs. Subscribe to our newsletter Join our email list for deals, pet parent tips and new products!

Home Bundle & Save! Personalized Dog Product Bundles What’s the story behind our chic new dog bundles? They’re the perfect combination of safety and style. That’s right: style! Fashion and accessorizing isn’t just for people, in our opinion. At dogIDs we want your furry pal to look great, too. If you’re bringing a new dog into your home, or you just want to give them a new coordinated look, then one of our starter kits with matching accessories is the choice for you. What’s in a Starter Kit? Our dog starter kits have the essentials you need to bring a new dog home, take your dog adventuring outside or just to give your dog a new outfit to proudly show off to the other dogs in the neighborhood. Each of our starter kits or ""Pup Packs"" as we like to call them is a multiple piece matching set which consists of a dogIDs: Dog Collar: Comfortable, safe, durable, and cuter than the leash! Dog Leash: Comfortable and easy to handle, and cuter than the collar! Personalized Tag: A personalized ID tag to help keep your doggo known and safely home! We offer a wide variety of colors, textures, materials, and themes for you to choose from—there’s something for every season, every mood, every doggo, and every flavor of your personality. Give it a try: Your friends at the park and the coffeehouse will smile grin with envy when they see your dog color-coordinated and regal as can be! Best of all, you’ll typically save about 20% by buying these items as a set rather than purchasing each piece individually. Find Fun Fashions for Your Pupper at dogIDs Our matching set bundles are just the beginning. At dogIDs we have a little of everything for your pup, including collars, leashes, harnesses, and the personalized ID tags that gave our company its name.

Our waterproof, nylon & leather products are made in the USA - most manufactured as you order it from our Fargo, ND workshop. We are constantly looking to expand our product offering by partnering with new USA based vendors that have the same values as we do. We also sell products that are not made in the USA. Though we do ensure that all products we sell are of the highest quality and that the suppliers of these products share the same values as dogIDs, we do not have control over where these products are sourced and therefore some of them are not produced in the USA. Our product team tries their hardest to put sourcing information right in the product description so that you have as much information as possible about where a product is made. Therefore, any Made in the USA product should be noted on the product page. However, if you have questions regarding the sourcing of a specific product, please contact our customer service team and we’d be happy to assist.

We Value Your Trust When you shop at dogIDs.com, we want to do our best to provide you with the best service & products that we can. That includes keeping your information safe and only using it when necessary. What do you do with my information? Do you share my information with anyone? Are my payments processed securely? When will you email me? Will you send me regular email marketing? What are cookies? What does dogIDs use cookies for? What other information does dogIDs track? Legal Information What if I have more questions on this policy? What do you do with my information? When you purchase our products over the phone or online, you provide us with basic information. This information may include: billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, form of payment, email address, pet information, product and service preferences, what you purchased and where (i.e., telephone and/or website). We use that information you provide to service your account, to ship an order to you, to provide warranty service on products and/or services you purchased, and to personalize your experience with our company. Do you share my information with anyone? Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company who intends to use it for marketing purposes without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product to the customer and improving the shopping experience for all of our customers. All data is requested, but can be removed at any time. Any information provided is used to track orders and use in marketing, if you have selected to join our mailing list. This data is tracked for 36 months, and can be removed at any time per request of customer. Are my payments processed securely? We use encryption and other types of technology to reasonably protect and safeguard your personal information and transactions, whether you purchase via a credit card, Amazon Pay or Paypal. If you pay for your purchase with credit card, whether it’s online or via telephone, we will never display or store your full credit card information.

We utilize SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the industry standard security protocol. All of your ordering information is encrypted using this secure server for maximum security. When will you email me? We do ask that all orders are placed using an email address so that dogIDs may send you a receipt for your purchase, notify you of status changes in regards to your order and notify you when your order is shipped. Those are the main emails you will receive when you purchase a product from us. 45 days after your purchase, you will also receive an email requesting that you submit a product review via our Third Party review platform, Stamped.io. It is your choice if you decide to submit a product review through this platform. They will send one additional email asking for a review if you don’t complete it after the first email. Stamped.io is also the service that provides question and answer options for our customers on the website. You may occasionally get an email asking for your perspective on a product for a current customer. You may choose to unsubscribe at any time from that marketing. Will you send me regular email marketing? If you choose to join our marketing email list, we will send out regular email newsletters to the address that you gave us with promotions, dog owner tips and new product announcements. You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails.
