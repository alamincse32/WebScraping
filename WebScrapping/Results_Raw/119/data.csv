And the RPM Sandbag is made right here in the USA! So why train with a sandbag? Sandbags are used for unstable load training, which helps improve core strength and stability. The filler shifts inside the sandbag when moved and as a result, your muscles are forced to work harder and continually make adjustments. Easily swap out the RPM Sandbag with any movement you perform with a barbell, dumbbell, or kettlebell! Sandbag exercise ideas: All the lunges - rorward, reverse, side, curtsy Single-leg deadlift Sumo squat Glute bridge Russian twist The bag itself has nine reinforced handles for versatile lifting, grappling, hauling, and throwing. It has an internal filler bag with a roll-top Velcro funnel, which makes it easy and mess-free to fill to your desired weight. The RPM Sandbag has the capacity to hold up to 70lb and is built to handle both home and commercial gyms. Choose one of the three patch weight labels for your own reference! Filler material NOT included. Dimensions 24"" x 7.25"" Material Durable 1000D Cordura nylon Handles 9 reinforced nylon webbing handles Filler Bag Internal filler bag with roll-top Velcro funnel Filler material (sand) NOT included.

He asked me what I thought and I was already on the airline’s website to change our tickets! We arrived for auditions in January of 2015 not knowing what to expect. We were one of over 700 other hopefuls that showed up that day. The producers told us it was going to be an easy in-and-out and not to expect any kind of follow-up. We’d have one minute to deliver our pitch and make it stick! Well, we apparently made an impression because we heard back within a couple of weeks. We were asked to make an audition tape. We had a blast filming! Erik Hopperstad, President and Brian Brasch, CEO filming their audition tape For our audition, we wanted to tell the story of where and why our products were created. A popular maker of CrossFit equipment was urging people to turn their garage into a gym. Well, that concept doesn't work for us in North Dakota so we came up with a line of products that fold up out of the way when not in use...thereby transforming your garage into a gym AND still allowing you to park your car in there. #ownthewall That worked. We had a film date! Oh wow, we had a film date! No idea what to expect As a small startup, the amount of preparation you have to do to get ready to go in the ‘Tank’ is crazy intense. It’s like pitching to a venture capitalist…except instead of culling your pitch to one VC, you have to prepare to go in front of five! And each of the five has different things they look for when sizing up a possible investment. So we tried to prepare ourselves for any one of the curveballs they could throw at us. The next few months were spent figuring out our pitch, working with the ABC team, and then finally practicing practicing practicing our intro to the Sharks. We can’t believe we were able to answer their questions with any semblance of coherency. Just shows what the brain can do under such intense pressure! That pesky non-disclosure agreement Erik Hopperstad, President and Brian Brasch, CEO filming Shark Tank So we filmed in June of 2015 and were under an extremely stringent non-disclosure agreement. We were allowed to share with our spouses and that was it. Here you’ve got the best news of your life and you can’t tell anyone! We couldn’t even share that we’d filmed, much less that we’d gotten a deal. Fast-forward to February – what a ride! We got official word in January that our episode was going to air, but didn’t get an actual air date. We heard in early February that we’d be airing on the 26th and could start actually telling people about two weeks prior to our episode airing. That’s when things really started to kick in to high speed! We had been talking about doing a website re-design and decided we really wanted to put our best foot forward for the influx of traffic we’d see. And then inventory. How do you prepare for something on this scale?!? We felt like we were in pretty good shape until ABC called us about noon on Thursday, February 18th to let us know our episode had gotten bumped up and would be airing on Sunday, February 21st instead of the original February 26th date. So yeah. We were still days away from putting the new website live, we hadn't contacted any press yet, we had to redo all our social posts with new dates, and we had planned to have inventory come in the week of the show, not prior. I think we all had our mini-meltdowns when we heard the news and then just got to work. We quickly re-scheduled the viewing party we had just gotten lined up, put the website redesign on steroids, contacted our vendors to get our materials here as fast as possible, and basically just tried to keep our heads above water for the next week or so! The Viewing Party We invited friends and family out to a local brewing company (thanks Drekker!) to join us to watch the live airing of our episode. What an amazing and fun night! It was wonderful to be surrounded by so much love and support for the big reveal. Everyone cheered when we got our deal and cheered even louder when we put up this photo that Kevin O'Leary's (our shark investor) publicist sent us! A buffed up Kevin O'Leary The next chapter After the episode aired, Kevin filmed a special video to congratulate us on our deal and with the message, 'go make me some money!' So our plans going forward are to do just that. We've got several products in the research and development pipeline and are excited to have additional resources to devote to that. ﻿Spoiler: Watch for our kickstarter coming soon for a product we know is going to be our most popular yet! 3 Responses Joshua Smith February 04, 2019 Would like to use yall in my gym when open and maybe get y’all to sell MMA stuff and gear also Paula Shaw April 21, 2017 Just saw your product on Shark Tank.

Whether you like to train solo or with a friend, having easy access to lifting equipment at home is a huge convenience. This is particularly evident with power racks, as they're versatile enough to perform so many exercises, including heavyweight movements such as squats and bench presses.

Our extensive testing process involved a holistic assessment of multiple factors, to evaluate each rack's durability, value, versatility and overall aesthetic. We thoroughly tested each power rack by performing powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting exercises, completing a collective 10+ sets and 100+ reps for each movement, using both comfortable and near-max weights. Attachments including pull-up bars and spotter arms were utilized and considered in testing as well. We consulted with both our MH Advisory Board, and our Strength in Diversity trainers to poll them on their experiences with the top racks, too.

Most models look like a durable, rugged steel cage that’s designed to serve as a base for your weighted workout equipment. Most also require adding optional add-ons if you want to use them for non-barbell exercises. There’s a lot to consider when shopping for the best home power rack for you:Style and functionality: Power racks can serve a wide variety of functions, including as a pull-up bar, a bench press, a squat rack—the list goes on. The best models are multifunctional to allow for dozens of full-body workouts. It all comes down to your workout style. Consider your regular workouts, and shop for power racks that offer everything you need. If you're short on space you can skip the pull-up bar. For a more full-featured option, you might want a beefy full power cage with multiple add-ons and attachments that expand your workout options.Weight capacity: Every power rack has a corresponding weight limit with most models ranging between 300 and 1,500 pounds. Always aim for a rack that has at least a 500-pound weight capacity. No, you may never lift 500 pounds on any single movement, but you'll thank yourself for having that margin for error if you ever miss on a squat and lose control of the bar. Customizability: The best power racks are customizable to fit your personal routine. From If you're tight on space, you might opt for a foldable racks, because they're great. From foot print size to height to additional accessory options, every cage will offers a slightly different level of customization. If you have larger home gym and are interesting in building things out, consider a power rack a strong starting point, and shop closely for the features that matter to you the most. Attachments: This is another place where, if you can afford it, it’s worth splurging on a rack with more adjustability to adapt to your workout needs now and in the future. In the long run, purchasing a rack that can grow with you will allow you to get more out of your home gym investment. At the very least, make sure the rack you choose comes with the basics like safety bars or straps, says David Otey, C.S.C.S., fitness writer and NYC-based strength coach. ""I would also recommend a landmine to diversify movements and band pegs to add variety to movements.""Durability: The type of construction is heavily tied in with a rack’s total weight capacity. Almost every model on the market today is made of steel, alloy steel, or powder-coated steel. The true measure of strength is the gauge of steel used. The higher gauge, the stronger the cage. Beginners may not need to worry about this when starting out. But better-quality steel will always be safer, more durable, better equipped to handle heavy weights, and more long-lasting.Power Rack vs. Half Rack: What's the Difference?As you might've noticed, we've included a few half racks in the list above. There's a distinct difference between power racks and half racks, but we've found that most people either don't have the space for a full rack, or don't really need more than a half rack at their fitness level. It's up to you to decide which would better suit your needs. ""A power rack is a 4-6 post rack you would do most of your lifts IN,"" explains Otey. Think of a power rack as a cage-like structure. It also features at least two horizontal bars catches on each side, which are adjustable in height and function as mechanical spotters. Most power racks leave room to be outfitted with a variety of accessories like pulleys, a lat pull down bar, etc. A half rack, on the other hand, is a shallow 4 post where lifts are executed on the outside of the rack, Otey told Men's Health. Half racks are comprised of 2 vertical posts and can also feature horizontal safety bars. That being said, the stability and maximum weight capacity associated with a half-rack is typically inferior compared to a power rack. There's also less room for add-on accessories. If you are limited on space or are a beginner, a half-rack could be a solid choice for you. If you only have room for a half rack and are concerned about stability, look for one that gives the user an option to anchor or bolt the equipment to the ground.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhy Buy a Power Rack?It all comes down to one thing according to Otey: safety. Yeah, you can lift a barbell at home without a power rack, but when it comes to lifting safely without a human spotter, we highly recommend using it. ""The key to working out at home is ensuring you are safe and there is no better way than having a power rack,"" he says.It's not a substitute for a human spot on your heaviest lifts (that's how injuries happen!), but it does offer you security and assurance you might not have otherwise. The right power rack can also set you up to do pull-ups, hanging abs movements, and much more. Especially in this era, when racks are expandable and have added attachments that can push you farther.As our Fitness Director Ebenezer Samuel puts it, ""This is the centerpiece of your home gym and it insures you're pushing yourself with leg training."" With a home power rack, you can have access to more weight and versatility compared to dumbbells and other home-gym accessories combined, allowing you to progress your lifts without scrambling to find heavier dumbbells or compound movements. Many power racks offer a selection of accessories that allow you to perform additional strength training exercises straight from the rack. These add-ons will cost you in addition to the cage itself, but if you want to get the most out of your home gym investment, you'll use a good power rack in a variety of ways.How to Use a Power RackA power rack can be used for virtually any barbell exercise you can think of. Think squatting, deadlift, bench pressing, all of the major lifts, says Otey. ""A power rack can be a one-stop gym where everything can be accomplished."" It's important to note that benches are often sold separately, and may not be included with a purchase of a cage. Depending on a rack's specifications and add-ons, you may be able to use it to perform a variety of non-barbell strength exercises such as lat pull downs, pull ups, and pulley exercises. Although many of these accessories are compatible with various racks, it’s important to use them only with the equipment they were designed for. Additionally, be sure to only shop for a power rack that your space can accommodate. Power racks should only be utilized on an even, non-slip surface (check out these best home gym flooring options), away from stairs.Why You Can Trust UsAt Men's Health, we take great pride in providing our readers with reliable and trustworthy product recommendations.

Through our extensive testing process, we considered every essential feature from construction and durability to overall dimensions and weight capacity, plus any extra features, such as delivery, warranties, ease of assembly, and aesthetic. Each rack was put to the test with powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting exercises, with a minimum of 10 sets and 100 reps performed at both comfortable and near-max weights for each movement. Attachments including pull-up bars and spotter arms were utilized and considered in testing as well. We consulted with both our MH Advisory Board, and our Strength in Diversity trainers to poll them on their experiences with the top racks, too.

Magazine Reveals Annual List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies—the Inc. 5000 NEW YORK, August 17, 2021 – Inc. magazine today revealed that PRx Performance is No. 420 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000. “420? Dude, we’re going to have fun with this! But in all seriousness, 2020 was an unprecedented and unbelievable year for our company—especially our staff. My cofounder and I are so grateful and proud of what our people accomplished amidst the chaos and unknown. We made a commitment early in the pandemic that as long as there was steel, we’d continue to produce and ship our equipment. Mission accomplished.” ~Brian Brasch, PRx Performance CEO Not only have the companies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but this year’s list also proved especially resilient and flexible given 2020’s unprecedented challenges. Among the 5,000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, those companies added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years. Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at www.inc.com/inc5000. The top 500 companies are featured in the September issue of Inc., which will be available on newsstands on August 20. “The 2021 Inc. 5000 list feels like one of the most important rosters of companies ever compiled,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing. This kind of accomplishment comes with hard work, smart pivots, great leadership, and the help of a whole lot of people.” PRx Performance is a pioneer in the manufacturing and distribution of space-saving fitness equipment. They made a deal with Kevin O’Leary when they appeared on Shark Tank in 2016 and have continued to innovate and grow exponentially year over year. CONTACT: Rachel Rice (rachelr@prxperformance.com) More about Inc. and the Inc. 5000 Methodology Companies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2017 to 2020. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2017. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2020. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2017 is $100,000; the minimum for 2020 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to three decimal places. There was one tie on this year’s Inc. 5000. Companies on the Inc. 500 are featured in Inc.’s September issue. They represent the top tier of the Inc. 5000, which can be found at http://www.inc.com/inc5000. About Inc.

Enhance your athletes' abilities while maximizing your club’s potential! Our 42-foot ninja rig allows athletes to hit every muscle group through obstacle courses, weight lifting, strength training, agility training, and anything else you can come up with! The Assassin Ninja Rig can be built out to 42 feet. Too much? No problem. This rig is fully customizable, made up of 4-foot and 6-foot sections with the capability of going from 8 feet up to 12 feet tall. Stealth personified, the Assassin Ninja Rig also easily converts into a cross-functional training and lifting space. The Ninja Rig accommodates 10 lifting stations for your athletes to work on not only their grip strength, but also their overall strength. Laser-cut numbers in each upright make J-cup placement easy for ninjas of all heights. Rest period? What rest period? Go from lifting to Ninjaing (yes it’s a word) in a flash! The Assassin Ninja Rig offers a nearly infinite number of obstacle courses or ninja warrior training possibilities with up to nine sections in 4-foot and 6-foot increments so there's no worry of your course getting stale. PLUS you can customize the height of each section up to 12 feet high. Move your pull-up bars around, add any number of accessories to improve grip strength, etc. If you can imagine it, you can build it!
