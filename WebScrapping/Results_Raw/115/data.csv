How deep can I install Goldflex? The installation procedures for Goldflex are similar to Goldline single-wall pipe and has similar burial depth recommendations. A minimum cover of 24” is recommended for standard agricultural equipment loading and a maximum cover of 8’ for standard plow installation in suitable soil. Deeper burial depths can be achieved in certain soils or with crushed rock surrounding the pipe. Q. How much research and development has been done on Goldflex? Over one million feet of Goldflex has been successfully installed throughout The United States and Canada in the past 6 years. These field tests, in addition to many laboratory tests, make Goldflex the most extensively tested flexible dual wall pipe on the market. Q. What types of perforations are available with Goldflex? Goldflex is available non-perforated, with narrow-slot perforations, or socked with standard perforations. Perforation configurations for all diameters and types of Prinsco pipe can be found in the Perforation Pattern Technical Note at Prinsco.com. Q. What’s the best way to connect coils of Goldflex? The most common way of connecting Goldflex is with an external snap coupler secured with heavy duty zip ties and a generous amount of tile tape. The tape should only contact the coupler, allowing the pipe to rotate within the coupler while uncoiling which helps reduce binding and stress on the pipe. Q. Do I need a custom boot to install Goldflex? Most factory boots designed to install large diameter single wall pipe can be used to install Goldflex of the same diameter. A minimum 50-inch bend radius is recommended to minimize the forces on the pipe as it moves through the boot. More specific boot dimensions are referenced in Prinsco’s Goldflex Installation Guide.

When installed according to manufacturer’s specifications, GOLDLINE GLP® pipe delivers unparalleled performance and years of trouble-free usage. It is available in easy-to-handle 10 and 20-foot lengths and requires a much smaller trench than conventional gravel-filled systems  meaning lower equipment costs and less installation time. GOLDLINE® with geotextile wrap is great for projects involving fine soil or flowable particles of soil. It comes with a non-woven, seamed sleeve or a knitted polyester continuous seamless sleeve. Fabric should not be used when installing in heavy soils (such as clay or loam) because it will inhibit water from entering the pipe. Contact your Prinsco sales rep to learn more about GOLDLINE® GLP.

It will also help fields with intermittent wet spots dry more uniformly. Will subsurface water management stress crops in dry years?Toggle While the greatest benefits of subsurface water management are realized in wet years, it also promotes deep root development which gives crops better access to soil moisture in dry years. By using a control structure with subsurface water management systems, water can also be held back throughout the growing season to keep moisture available to crops when it is needed most. Will adding subsurface water management to a field increase chances of flooding in local streams?Toggle Prinsco subsurface water management systems promote greater infiltration rates in the soil. This allows for more water to be pulled down into the soil, decreasing the amount of runoff. Water that is pulled into the soil is released from tile into waterways more slowly than it would be flowing over land. Therefore, the chance for flooding actually decreases. Research has shown that adding subsurface water management increases the base flow by 5-10%, but only after the chance for flooding has dissipated. What tile spacing should I use for a field?Toggle There are several factors that affect how you should space between tile lines, including soil type, tile depth, drainage coefficient, and tile diameter. Drainage coefficients determine the rate at which water will be removed from the soil and typically range from 1/8” – 1” per 24 hours. Depending on your soil type, the drainage coefficient you use will determine what spacing you need to maximize the yield and profitability of your system. When should I consider smaller pipe perforations or the use of pipe sock?Toggle First, it is necessary to understand the properties of the soil at the depth your pipe will be installed. A soil test should be performed to determine the soil type and particle size. Heavy soils such as clay or loam will typically require standard perforated pipe, while sandy soils will likely require sock or narrow slot pipe. When deciding between sock versus narrow slot pipe, consider the 25% rule — if soils are less than 25% clay, they probably need sock pipe. How should dual wall pipe joints be assembled?Toggle Pipe equipped with integral bell and spigot joints, such as Prinsco’s ECOFLO® 100 or GOLDFLO WT®, must be installed by inserting the spigot into the bell. Pushing the bell onto the spigot increases the likelihood of bedding material being forced into the joint, disrupting the gasket and severely undermining joint performance. Pipe laying should always begin at the outlet with the spigots pointed downgrade. When are fields too flat to drain? How would I provide an adequate outlet for a subsurface water management system?Toggle In order for tile laterals to provide proper subsurface water management, a minimum grade of 0.05 to 0.1% should be maintained. Where the topography does not allow for a gravity flow outlet, pumped outlets can be used. Prinsco’s Ag Catch Basins provide the right storage solution for pumped outlets. What is the maximum burial depth for the pipe?Toggle Achieving maximum burial depths is largely dependent on proper installation practices. For burial depths of 8 feet or less, Prinsco recommends a shapedbottom trench. For burial depths of more than 8 feet, a standard trench installation should be used as shown in our Ag Installation Guide. Proper installation positively contributes to the load carrying capacity of the pipe, resulting in greater burial depths. Contact your local Prinsco representative to discuss maximum burial depths for your installation. Can water be sent from one watershed into a different watershed?Toggle No. Most state drainage laws are clear that water may not be transferred from one watershed to another. Adding water to a watershed can cause increased erosion. For example, increasing water flow in a in a stream can cause an unstable stream bank.

For AASHTO HL-93, H-25 or HS-25 loading, pipe with diameters of 4”-48” shall have a minimum of one foot of cover, while 60” diameter pipe must have at least 18 inches of cover. Cover heights are measured from the top of the pipe to the bottom of flexible pavement or to the top of rigid pavement. Minimum covers assume Class III backfill material compacted to 90% standard Proctor density around the pipe and a minimum of 6-inches over the pipe crown. For construction loading, additional backfill may be necessary. For heavy construction loads between 30-60 tons, a minimum of 3 feet of cover shall be used. What is the maximum burial depth for HDPE pipe?Toggle Refer to the Minimum and Maximum Burial Depth per AASHTO Tech Note The maximum cover is significantly influenced by the type of backfill material used and level of compaction. Special care is necessary for deep burial depth installations. For burial depths that exceed recommendations, contact your Prinsco Representative to review the site specific information. What is the load rating for HDPE pipe?Toggle HDPE is a flexible pipe that relies heavily on the strength of the embedment soil for its strength. With the requirements for minimum cover met, HDPE pipe is rated for AASHTO H-25 loading. Refer to the Standard Trench Installation Detail for backfill and compaction requirements. Note that the minimum burial depth requirements for parallel pipe installations may require additional cover. For heavier loading scenarios, contact your Prinsco Representative. Are recycled materials used in HDPE pipe?Toggle Prinsco manufactures pipe to meet the specifications of AASHTO M294 & M252 which require virgin compounds be used for the manufacturing process. However, Prinsco has incorporated recycled resins into their manufacturing process for over 10 years and have mastered the blending process. After years of blending technology and research, Prinsco has manufactured a product called ECOFLO® 100 that utilizes 40% recycled material and has a 100 year service life. That kind of performance is unprecedented in a recycled product. ECOFLO® 100 meets or exceeds the requirements of AASHTO M294 with the exception of the recycled content. Does HDPE pipe have UV resistance?Toggle HDPE pipe meeting the requirements of AASHTO M294 or M252 is manufactured with carbon black colorant which protects the pipe from UV degradation. Carbon black has been proven to protect pipe for years without affecting the performance. Once the pipe is installed, the pipe is no longer exposed to UV degradation. The exposed ends of the pipe will not be subjected to the stresses of buried pipe and are not a consideration for the effects of UV degradation. How do I connect HDPE to dissimilar materials?Toggle The most common method for joining dissimilar products is to butt the ends together, wrap the connection in a non-woven geotextile wrap and pour a concrete collar around the connection. Prinsco also offers a number of fittings and accessories including clay adapters, fabricated pipe adapters, and Marmac Couplers for joining dissimilar products. Contact your local Prinsco representative for the best option for your application. What is the maximum amount of misalignment for bell and spigot connections using GOLDFLO WT® or ECOFLO® 100?Toggle During pipe joint assembly, it is critical to ensure the pipe lengths are aligned both vertically and horizontally. Improper alignment will result in difficult or improper joint assembly and may cause the pipe joint to leak. If the misalignment is necessary for grade or curvilinear alignment, a maximum of 1 degree of misalignment is recommended. Prinsco offers a wide array of standard and custom fittings for curved alignments. Contact your local Prinsco Representative for more information. What is the difference between underground retention and detention systems?Toggle Underground retention & detention systems are both designed to collect stormwater and release it at controlled rate to eliminate downstream flooding. The main difference is between the two is the period of time the water is retained within the system. A detention system is designed to slow and temporarily hold stormwater runoff in a contained area until it can be released at a controlled rate. The outlet of the system is typically at the lowest point in the system, allowing the system to slowly, but completely drain. A retention system is also designed to slow and temporarily hold stormwater runoff, however the containment pipe is perforated allowing for the water to infiltrate into the soil and recharge the groundwater table. The outlet of the retention system is typically placed near the highest point of the system. This allows the stormwater to flow downstream in the event of excessive or strong storms without backing up the system upstream.

When installed according to the manufacter’s specifications, GOLDLINE GLP® pipe delivers unparalleled performance and years of trouble-free usage. It is available in easy-to-handle 10 and 20 foot lengths and requires a much smaller trench than conventional gravel-filled systems  meaning lower equipment costs and less installation time. GOLDLINE® GLP with geotextile wrap is great for projects involving fine soil or flowable particles of soil. It comes with a non-woven, seamed sleeve or a knitted polyester continuous seamless sleeve. Fabric should not be used when installing in heavy soils (such as clay or loam) because it will inhibit water from entering the pipe. Contact your Prinsco sales rep to learn more about GOLDLINE® GLP.

Why? Because less than 3% of the earth’s water is fresh, and of that, only a small fraction is accessible and usable to humans. Add to that the ever-increasing demand for clean water by our growing population and the negative impacts of urbanization, and it’s clear that our world’s most important natural resource is under stress. Stormwater runoff is a key factor to water quality issues, and Prinsco is continuously innovating to improve the performance of stormwater conveyance and storage solutions. We are also a pioneer in the development of agricultural subsurface drainage solutions to improve crop performance and reduce the amount of sediment and nitrates in the runoff entering our fresh water supply. Agricultural Efficiency & Production By 2050, our world will have over 9 billion mouths to feed, requiring a 50% increase in our current food supply. That’s a stunning reality. Add to that the ongoing loss of tillable farmland due to erosion and urban development, and we’ve got no choice but to implement innovative, long term solutions that can maximize agricultural efficiency and improve the impact of available water. Prinsco was one of the first companies to introduce HDPE drainage tile to the agricultural industry over 35 years ago. Today, we’re known for providing innovative, eco-friendly water management solutions that can increase yields from 15% up to 25%, and control water in order to maintain consistent production levels throughout weather fluctuations. Sustainable Systems & Products Our world’s most valuable resources are in limited supply. There will never be any more land, water, or fossil fuels, making environmental stewardship everyone’s responsibility. Prinsco has invested the time, research, and resources into the advancement of recycled plastic technology allowing us to develop recycled materials without compromising performance.

Jamie Duininck CEO Ways my work helps customers: I enjoy meeting people and establishing great relationships on behalf of Prinsco and my sales team. My job is to support their work in whatever way I can in order to help customers have the best experience possible. Career & life experiences that make me better at my job: I grew up in this business, which gives me a deep sense of appreciation and responsibility to its history, values and reputation. As a third generation owner, I am excited about the way we are building on our foundation and continuing to grow. I am also a husband and father, which keeps me balanced and focused on what’s most important! Todd Buness President / CFO Ways my work helps customers: I strive to understand our customers’ needs and challenges so that I can help our finance team serve our internal customers with the information and support they need to provide a superior customer experience. Career & life experiences that make me better at my job: I grew up in northern Minnesota where my father taught me the values of honesty, integrity and hard work. I started my career after college at Cargill in the finance function within the Agriculture industry for over 25 years. I was fortunate to live in Southeast Asia with Cargill to gain valuable experiences with other cultures and businesses that have helped shape my leadership abilities. I left the Agriculture industry to join a Medical Component manufacturing company for 4 years where I learned a lot about serving customers and the value of quality in our products. I have now found a dream opportunity with Prinsco where I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences to help achieve our vision. Mark Johnson Vice President of Operations Ways my work helps customers: As the Vice President of Operations I have responsibility for all of Prinsco’s manufacturing facilities, yards, transportation, and our supply chain. Our focus in operations is to provide the best quality product for our customers, when they need it and without any mistakes. I take a lot of pride in the fact that all of our Prinsco team members strive to live our values of hard work, integrity, and relationships every day because it is who we are and it is what our customers expect….“One Prinsco.” Career and life experiences that make me better at my job: I have had a broad range of career experiences ranging from being a Police Officer to a Safety Manager, to a Black Belt Lean Manager, to a Plant Manager of a large food production facility. These career experiences have given me some unique life experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I believe that hard work and accountability are key foundations to success but also know you cannot excel in business or in life without a strong team.
