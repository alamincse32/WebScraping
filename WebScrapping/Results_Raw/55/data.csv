We do not share information we gather with other websites or any other entities or individuals unless such sharing is disclosed to you in advance through this Notice. Other linked websites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to our control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policy of the websites you may visit by linking from the sites (including by linking through social media features on the sites, such as through a Facebook ""Like"" button). Please note that this Notice applies only to our sites, and not to other companies' or organizations' websites to which we link. On certain sites, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to enable you to purchase an Offering or make payments on a third-party payment service provider website (""Payment Service""). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a page operated by that Payment Service. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Notice. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service. VII. SOCIAL MEDIA As noted above, one source through which we may collect information is from social media platforms (which may share information about how you interact with our social media content). We do not control how your personal information is collected, stored or used by such third-party websites or to whom it is disclosed. You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social media website that you subscribe to so that you understand the information they collect and may be sharing. If you do not want a social media website to share information about you, you must contact that website and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt-out of sharing such information. Schwan's is not responsible for how these third-party websites may use information collected from or about you. VIII. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION We generally retain your information as long as reasonably necessary to comply with our document retention policy and applicable law, applicable statute of limitations, or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. IX. MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing and promotional messages from Schwan's, if those messages are powered by Schwan's, by following the instructions in those messages. If you decide to unsubscribe, you will still receive non-promotional communications relevant to your use of our Offerings. X.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at CONTACT INFORMATION. XI. SECURITY We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of data. We hold information about you both at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.

For example, Schwanâs cannot delete your personal information if it is being used as a part of a current contract or transaction. Schwanâs will inform you of such exceptions in its response to your request. Depending on how the applicable privacy law defines a âsale,â we may sell personal information to third parties. For instance, if you are a resident of Colorado or Connecticut, our use of cookies and tracking technologies constitutes a sale of personal information to third-party advertisers. Please note, Schwanâs does not sell, re-sell, distribute for re-sale, or share your personal information except where our use of website tracking technology equates to a âsaleâ of personal information. We also use cookies and other tracking technologies to display advertisements about our products to you on nonaffiliated websites, applications, and online services. This is âtargeted advertisingâ under applicable privacy laws. We do not use personal information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning individuals MAKING A REQUEST AND VERIFICATION If we receive a request from you, we will first make a determination regarding the applicability of your stateâs law, and we will then take steps to verify your identity prior to responding. The steps to verify your identity may vary based on our relationship with you, but, at a minimum for your protection, Schwan's is required to collect certain information from you to verify your identity before we respond to any request submitted by you. To verify any request or exercising of rights described here, you will be required to provide information to verify your identity (e.g., name, address, and e-mail address). Failure to do so could result in Schwan's inability to comply with your request. The information you provide to verify your identity will only be used for verification purposes, and a record of your request, including certain information contained within it, will be maintained by Schwan's for its files. If you would like to exercise your privacy rights and make a request as described here, please use the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION and contact Schwan's. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may make requests regarding your data one to two times a year, free of charge. However, Schwanâs may charge a reasonable fee or deny a request that is considered manifestly unfounded or excessive. Schwanâs will respond to your request within 45 days. If for any reason your request is denied, Schwanâs will provide a âno actionâ explanation within the 45-day period. If your jurisdiction offers you a right to appeal such denial, you will be informed of your right to appeal that decision. For residents of certain states,Â your rights as stated here can also be exercised by an authorized agent on your behalf. Where a state law, regulation, or regulator has described the process for establishing an authorized agent, Schwanâs will follow the standards set by that state law.Â For example, the Attorney General of California has set certain standards regarding designation of an authorized agent to exercise rights under Californiaâs privacy legislation, which you may review to ensure you are submitting a compliant request. Schwan's can deny any request made by an agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized by a resident to act on that resident's behalf. NON-DISCRIMINATION FOR EXERCISING PRIVACY RIGHTS Under the privacy law of certain states, residents of those states have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Schwan's or any business for the exercise of their privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain privacy rights by those residents may make it so that Schwan's is no longer able to provide those residents with certain aspects of the Offerings. For example, if, at the request of a California resident, Schwan's deletes all of the California resident's personal information that it maintains, Schwan's will no longer be able to send marketing communications to that resident unless that resident re-submits personal information to Schwan's. NO SALE OF INFORMATION As previously stated, except as may be defined uniquely by state privacy laws, Schwan's has not, in the last 12 months, sold your information, nor does Schwan's have plans to sell your information in the future. DO NOT TRACK âOpt-Out Preference Signals,â âGlobal Privacy Control (GPC),â and âDo Not Trackâ (âDNTâ) are browser settings and/or downloadable signals that allow users to notify websites of an individualâs privacy preferences. For example, DNT is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites you visit that you do not wish to be tracked. Such browser settings must be supported by the website you are visiting to be effective. Currently, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to these signal. As such,Â SchwanâsÂ is not currently able to support such browser codes, and Schwanâs will not automatically acknowledge and/or respond to your particular settings when you access the Offerings.Â However, you may make a request to opt-out of or limit any processing activities as described herein or through the links available on the Offering. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (âCCPAâ), requires that we provide California residents with a privacy policy that contains a comprehensive description of our online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, sale, sharing, and retention of personal information and of the rights of California residents regarding their personal information. This section of the Privacy Notice is intended solely for, and is applicable only as to, California residents.

Although we do not âsellâ personal information as that term may be commonly interpreted, we engage in online activities that may constitute a sale or a share of personal information under California law. This may include showing you advertisements on other websites.Â The following table identifies the categories of Personal Information that we sold or shared to third parties in the 12 months preceding the last update of this Privacy Notice and, for each category, the category of third parties to whom we sold or shared Personal Information.

Notice of Financial Incentive From time to time, you may have the opportunity to provide personal information in exchange for discounts and price differences.

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will remove you from those companiesâ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through the Schwanâs Offerings or on other third party websites. Even if you opt-out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt-out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out action may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAAâs website atwww.aboutads.info or the NAIâs website at https://www.networkadvertising.org/.
