8,"About | Quality Meats And Seafood Home Products Beef Chicken Pork Sausage Seafood Recipes About Contact The highest Quality. The best Customer Service. Home / About About In 1967 Tom Blakeway started Quality Boneless Beef Co., Inc. to supply the Fargo-Moorhead area with ground beef materials. The business was run by just Tom and one other meat cutter. Tom would go out in the morning making deliveries of ground beef and take orders for the following day. He would come back to the plant in the afternoons, put on a frock and help with the boning of cattle for the next days deliveries. Tom’s concept was simple, to supply a fresh, quality product to the retail and restaurant trade in the area. Tom expanded the business by adding more products such as steaks, pork chops, ground beef patties, and chicken and then had to hire some more meat cutters and a sales staff to handle business. In 1976 Fargo Packing Company was purchased and the Valley Maid line of products were added. Also the market territory was expanded to all of North Dakota, South Dakota, and northwest Minnesota. Since 1980 the fresh meat side of the business has been expanded to include boxed beef, products from other meat processors, and a complete line of seafood, shrimp, lobster and fish fillets were added. With those added products came a name change, from Quality Boneless Beef, to Quality Meats and Seafood. Quality Meats and Seafood employs around 90 people between its two facilities. Fargo Packing Company processes a wide variety of smoked sausages, smoked hams, and bacon. This plant was recently upgraded to handle a larger capacity of items. Quality’s main plant is located at 700 Center Street, in West Fargo, where all of our distribution is done at. It was expanded in 1986 to include a large freezer and a modern processing facility for ground beef and portion cut steaks. The company has been 100% employee owned since 2003. Today, Quality Meats and Seafood still combines old style quality with today’s marketing tools to provide the end-user with the highest standard of quality and service they demand. Tom retired in the late eighties, the high standards that Tom began with in 1967. have been continually met throughout the years. While the product line has significantly expanded over the years, product quality and customer satisfaction has always been the most important ingredient in our business strategy, and will continue to be in the future.
