Antibiotic-free selection provided by RNA-OUT The RNA-OUT platform works by repressing the expression of a counter-selectable marker (SacB) from the host chromosome. SacB encodes for the levansucrase enzyme, which creates a toxic environment in the presence of sucrose, which leads to cell death. Transforming the Antibiotic-free Nanoplasmid in the host expresses a 150bp RNA-OUT antisense RNA (ROUT) that binds the SacB mRNA and represses levansucrase expression, prevents toxicity and to maintain cell survival. The RNA-OUT selectable marker can be used to retrofit existing antibiotic resistance DNA plasmids into antibiotic-free vectors counter-selection system.

Eureca-V targets a T-rich PAM domain and creates a staggered double-strand break at the target locus. Learn More Case Examples Large-scale GMP-compliant CRISPR-Cas9–mediated deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor in multivirus-specific T cells Virus-specific T cells (VSTs) are highly effective in treating infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Graft-versus-host disease is a common complication of HSCT, so many patients receive prophylactic glucocorticoids to suppress immune response and better enable HSC engraftment. Treatment with glucocorticoids can often lead to viral reactivation, which can be life threatening for immunosuppressed patients. Unfortunately, this treatment with glucocorticoids also limits the effect of follow-on VST therapy, as they are lymphocytotoxic and induce apoptosis in T cells. In this paper, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center describe a GMP-compliant method to manufacture CRISPR gene-edited VSTs that are unaffected by glucocorticoid treatment. These CRISPR-edited VSTs have comparable potency to non-gene edited VSTs but could be co-administered to patients with steroids. The GMP manufacturing workflow applies Aldevron SpyFi™ Cas9 Nuclease as the gene editing reagent due to its high on-target editing efficiency and greatly reduced off-target editing in comparison to wild-type SpCas9. https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001977 Basar, R., Daher, M., Uprety, N., Gokdemir, E., Alsuliman, A., Ensley, E., Ozcan, G., Mendt, M., Hernandez Sanabria, M., Kerbauy, L.

Large-scale GMP-compliant CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor in multivirus-specific T cells. Blood advances, 4(14), 3357–3367. Modeling, optimization, and comparable efficacy of T cell and hematopoietic stem cell gene editing for treating hyper-IgM syndrome X-linked hyper-IgM Syndrome (HIGM1) is a recessive genetic disorder that causes B cells to overproduce IgM antibodies and underproduce IgG, IgA, and IgE. In a healthy immune response, T cells signal B cells to undergo a process called “class switching recombination” in which the cell produces different classes of antibodies that will bind to a given antigen. HIGM1 is caused by inactivating mutations to the CD40LG gene resulting in disruption of the CD40 cell signaling pathway. Patients suffering from HIGM1 are susceptible to a variety of bacterial infections and have poor prospects for long term survival. Correction of relevant mutations in T cells has long been explored as a strategy to cure HIGM1. In this paper, researchers at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET) compared two different gene correction strategies – autologous T cell therapy and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) therapy. When they detected off-target editing at least one locus, the research team switched to Aldevron SpyFi™ Cas9 Nuclease to reduce this off-target activity below detectable levels. Both T-cell and HPSC therapeutic approaches were effective at rescuing immune response in mouse models, but the research team ultimately concluded that T-cell therapy would be a more promising clinical strategy. https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202013545 Vavassori, V., Mercuri, E., Marcovecchio, G.

CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted genome editing for correction of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa using iPS cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116(52), 26846–26852. Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907081116 Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show great promise as a therapeutic tool for a wide variety of human diseases. Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into any human cell type, allowing researchers to create patient-specific cell lines that do not carry a risk of rejection in vivo. iPSCs are derived from adult cells, so their study is less controversial than embryonic stem cells for equivalent conditions. Stem cell therapy shows great promise in treating dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a rare recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that results in fragile skin and painful skin blistering. In this paper, researchers at Columbia University use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to correct COL7A1 mutations in patient iPSCs. Gene-modified cells were differentiated into keratinocytes and fibroblasts before transplantation and engraftment into a mouse model. Transplanted cells successfully rescued the wild-type skin phenotype and did not show evidence of tumorigenesis, a documented concern for iPSC therapeutics. The research team applied Aldevron SpyFi™ Cas9 Nuclease due to the reduction in off-target editing and equivalent on-target performance in comparison to wild-type SpCas9.

Through evolving routes of direct delivery of the CRISPR-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, consisting of single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas nucleases, a non-viral approach has become increasingly in demand for gene-editing clinical trials. However, drug developers face significant challenges when initiating their clinical programs, which includes the design and production of the target-specific guides, the production of reliable, high-quality nucleases, and the ability to characterize the RNP complex for the efficient and safe delivery of a genomic therapy. November 14, 202312 – 1 p.m. ET (9-10 a.m. PT) In this webinar, Oat Khodthong, PhD from Aldevron and Garrett Rettig, PhD from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) will highlight how our partnership and services will accelerate new CRISPR-based therapies to support genomic medicine. IDT will spotlight their capabilities in chemistry and oligo production for high-quality CRISPR gRNAs, while Aldevron will detail an expertise in cGMP CRISPR nuclease and RNP manufacturing and characterization*. We have brought our synergistic services together to provide drug development partners with complete CRISPR genome editing solutions. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FROM THIS WEBINAR: IDT’s capability of manufacturing chemically-modified, high-quality guide RNAs Overview of the analytical testing to fully characterize the RNP complex Benefits of working with Aldevron and IDT for your CRISPR-RNP project *Aldevron provides RNPs only to customers who are duly licensed, including to make and have made RNPs, for their intended use.

Our high-purity, high-homogeneity, low-endotoxin plasmid DNA is ideal for any transfection application. Case Study: A client suffered from very low plasmid production yields using other vendors. Our optimization resulted in a 9X increase in the yield per liter of media. In addition, the purity far exceeded that of previous manufacturing attempts. Gene therapy From ITR-bearing cis-plasmids to very large helper plasmids, our manufacturing technology produces high yields even for the most difficult constructs. Case Study: A client required 95% monomer plasmid DNA as the final deliverable. The starting material provided was predominantly dimerized/multimeric. Our team linearized the material, ligated it back together to create the monomer, and transformed. We achieved the required specification for both the supercoiled and linearized plasmid DNA deliverable. In vivo studies for DNA vaccines With a consistent manufacturing process from research grade through clinical production, we ensure reliable, high-quality DNA for your vaccine program. Case Study: When West Nile virus threatened the survival of endangered condors in California, we were contracted to manufacture a DNA vaccine developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our production and quality control systems allowed us to manufacture the vaccine in less than two months. The vaccine went on to protect other endangered species against West Nile virus. RNA template Whether your application is a messenger RNA therapeutic or guide RNA for CRISPR-Cas9, we have extensive experience producing linearized plasmid DNA using a variety of enzymes with advanced purification techniques. Case Study: A client required a high yield and consistent poly(A) tail length for their template. We evaluated a variety of resin and buffer combinations as well as post-linearization purification strategies. The result was 90-95% recovery of linearized DNA with a consistently high poly(A) tail length.

A formidable financial, logistical, and regulatory hurdle in all genetic therapies is attaining scalable clinic-grade manufacture of the experimental therapeutic. The current costs, timelines, and requirements in that space make the vast majority of genetic disease intractable in a practical sense. Dr. Urnov will discuss the unique nature of CRISPR-Cas as a platform technology that brings the promise of leveraging nonclinical and manufacturing information from one disease indication to another, potentially without repeating redundant, costly, and time-consuming nonclinical studies. The non-viral delivery of CRISPR-Cas, including as a Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), is a strong case study, where key aspects of the manufacturing framework could be leveraged between disease indications. Dr. Urnov will assess the latest progress in clinical genome editing and discuss how further progress could be enabled by creative academia-industry partnerships to develop and reduce to real-world-practice manufacturing innovation in the ""CRISPR-Cas as a therapeutic platform"" space. This presentation is closely aligned with Dr. Urnov's December 2022 opinion piece in the New York Times, and with the recently released paper “Genome editing in the mouse brain with minimally immunogenic Cas9 RNPs."" published in Molecular Therapy, the official journal of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. Aldevron leaders Tom Foti, VP/GM of our Protein Business Unit, and Tim Morris, Manager of Upstream Processing, are listed as contributors to the paper. Both Tom and Tim will help moderate audience questions with Dr. Urnov after his presentation.

Vendors and participants buzz around to decide what presentations and meetings to attend, and which vendors they want to see. During the event, Aldevron had two highlighted speaking slots that attracted a good amount of attention. Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMO) are a timely topic, which led to a panel discussion that included Aldevron Chief Scientific Officer Venkata Indurthi. During the panel, Cell and Gene Therapy CDMO Selection and External Manufacturing Best Practices, some of the topics touched on were: How to select CDMO partners? How are CDMOs planning for the rapid expansion in the CGT field? Understanding CDMO capacities, timelines, and capabilities Qualification, and quality agreements for commercial manufacturing There was a strong turnout, with a lot of good dialogue surrounding the topic. That continued at a happy hour Aldevron hosted that evening, where we were able to share viewpoints with our clients in a more relaxed setting. We also had a featured presentation by Patrick Paez, Technical Marketing Manager, as he discussed, A Next-Generation Plasmid Demonstrated to Improve Non-Viral Vector Manufacturing – Nanoplasmidᵀᴹ. Paez pointed out several key Nanoplasmid benefits during the talk, including: Replacing antibiotic resistance with RNA-OUT technology Improving performance across multiple applications using Nanoplasmids versus traditional plasmids Reducing manufacturing costs by increasing yield Our presentations offered us an opportunity to answer a lot of questions regarding both CDMO capabilities and Nanoplasmid options. We appreciated the conversations and look forward to continuing our discussions with everyone we met at the event, and we look forward to seeing everyone again next year.

Both have insightful viewpoints of their trade, with the CSO closely working in the world of both academic and industrial research for development of drug products from conception to commercialization. In the case of Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs), it is like a car, very practical for getting you from one point to another. They are designed to be a reliable partner to (tech) transfer material for your company, allowing a streamlined process in your development programs. For Venkata Indurthi, Ph.D., Aldevron’s CSO, he applied both of those approaches in his editorial article, “CSOs in CDMOs giving mRNA manufacturing considerations,” in the latest edition of International Biopharmaceutical Industry (IBI).In mRNA drug product manufacturing, skill and experience are critical when planning, developing and executing the mRNA production from sequence to vial. Therefore, when designing mRNA drug products, it is important to note several considerations before moving forward. It’s similar to making coffee, where the process is very critical, from bean to cup, to make the perfect brew. With the process of mRNA drug product manufacturing, each step has standard methods, but also has very practical knowledge and techniques to get the correct product. With that, we invite you to grab a perfectly brewed cup of coffee and read the IBI editorial, “CSOs in CDMOs giving mRNA manufacturing considerations.” It provides the opportunity to learn more about standards and practical processes for mRNA drug product manufacturing, with Indurthi’s thoughts on the sector.

For example, we may aggregate certain information technology-related data of yours with others’ data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature on our website. We may use Aggregated Data for any purpose without restriction. However, if we re-combine or re-connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Policy.
