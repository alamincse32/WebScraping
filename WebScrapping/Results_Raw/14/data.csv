Rapat was hired to provide a fixed tripper and new drive components for an existing barge load-out conveyor and to construct a new trussed conveyor with support structure. The client’s existing conveyor was crucial to the plant’s operation, yet there was limited documentation from the original supplier. In the end, Rapat was successful in specifying the project and constructing the new fixed tripper, while keeping the plant’s downtime to a minimum.

Rapat delivered a complete integrated solution, including enclosed conveyors, diverters, gates, transfer chutes, bucket elevators and support structures. The gates and diverters had to be specially designed for the unique application, and other considerations were made throughout the system to ensure proper flow, while minimizing wear from the abrasive sand. Transfer chute arrangement and design was especially critical to the system’s success.

Rapat was hired to supply totally enclosed galvanized belt conveyors, bucket elevators, transfer chutes and support galleries. Beyond normal technological hurdles, the material handling capacities to quickly unload rail cars and load ships were very high. The site also was adjacent to residential areas, so quiet, dust-tight designs were essential. Rapat successfully incorporated all the client requirements, while navigating the harsh North Pacific Ocean environmental conditions, which made structural design work critical.

12,"RAPAT | Malt Processing Facility, Minnesota Search 🔍 Products Case Studies About Us Support Careers Contact Malt Processing Facility, Minnesota Home > Case Studies > Malt Processing Facility, Minnesota Malt Processing Facility, Minnesota Project Type: Malt Processing Facility Location: Minnesota Capacities: 85 TPH A client looking to reduce maintenance costs and product degradation decided to replace nine existing drag conveyors with an enclosed belt conveyor to transfer malted barley from their kilns to a rail load-out area. The project was complicated by minimal clearance at both transition points and the three active rail spurs that lay between. Rapat invited a structural engineering firm to do a field survey and review the existing structure at the conveyor discharge location. The latest 3D scanning technology was used to successfully verify clearance at both ends and support bent locations by inserting the conveyor model directing into the computer generated layout.
