If fact, the whole concept of Proof Artisan Distillers evolved at campfires with lifelong neighbors that live “2 Docks down” at the lake. More than five years of planning, preparation, licensing, and construction took place in launching the distillery located in downtown Fargo, ND. In early 2015, Proof Artisan Distillers produced the inaugural run of 2Docks Vodka using locally grown potatoes.Since opening, as the first legal whiskey distillery in North Dakota, Jay & Joel have had the honor of sharing their passion for quality through the production of nationally awarded 2Docks, Minions Gins, Crooked Furrow Bourbons and Glen Fargo American Malt Whiskey. All utilizing North Dakota grown potatoes, barley and corn. Collectively, these spirits have won over 30 national awards and recognitions.Sharing a passion for uncompromising standards. Quality is assured by attention to every detail throughout the process. From the selection of grains, to the mash, fermentation, and distillation. From the specifications of barrels, to barrel maturation, and on to final barrel conditioning and bottling.Meticulous attention is paid to every detail. Grain to Barrel to Bottle to Glass.“Through Proof, I’m honored for the opportunity to create the spirits that I have always enjoyed and excited to share my passion of craft, small-batch distilling.”-Joel Kath, Owner & Distiller Our Location Proof Artisan Distillers414 4th Ave N, Fargo, ND 58102General Inquiries: proof@proofdistillers.com Events/tasting/tours: events@proofdistillers.com Facebook-f Linkedin Youtube Instagram Tasting Room Hours Monday 9:00am - 5:00pm Tuesday 9:00am - 5:00pm Wednesday 9:00am - 5:00pm Thursday 9:00am - 5:00pm Friday 9:00am - 5:00pm Saturday Closed Sunday Closed Photo Gallery All Rights Reserved.

A beautiful 25′ copper still, ‘The Judge’, is located near the original judges’ chambers. A massive bar, dating back to 1892, ordains the tasting room and proudly serves as the showcase for the mixology of Proof’s award-winning spirits.
