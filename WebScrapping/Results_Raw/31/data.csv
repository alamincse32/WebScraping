Technology Application As featured in Appareo’s two flight apps for pilots, Stratus Insight and Stratus Horizon Pro, the custom speech recognition system ATC Transcription makes the company one of the world leaders in aviation artificial intelligence. ATC Transcription is a recurrent neural network that transcribes analog or digital aviation audio into text in near-real time. This in-house artificial intelligence, trained with Appareo’s proprietary dataset of flight-deck audio, takes the terabytes of training data and its accompanying transcriptions and reduces that content to a powerful 160 MB model that can be run inside the aircraft. Benefits of ATC Transcription: Available today, the ACU-200 was designed to DO-160G and is shipping as Type or Supplemental Type certified. For customers that prefer to internally develop software on Conexus products, a software development kit (SDK) is available for simplified custom application development.Features: Provides improved situational awareness by identifying, capturing, and presenting ATC communications relevant to your aircraft’s operation for review or replay. Provides the ability to stream transcribed speech to on-board (avionic) or off-board (iPad/iPhone) display sources. Provides a continuous representation of secondary audio channels (ATIS, AWOS, etc.) for review in textual form, allowing your attention to focus on a single channel. …and more. What makes ATC Transcription special is the context-specific training work that Appareo has done, using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development techniques, to create an AI that understands the aviation industry vocabulary. Other natural language processing work is easily confused by the cadence, noise, and vocabulary of the aviation industry, yet Appareo’s groundbreaking work has overcome these barriers and brought functional artificial intelligence to the cockpit. No Cloud Required It is very difficult to run speech recognition models locally at the edge (e.g. inside an aircraft or other vehicle without connecting to the cloud). Typical language processing AI systems leverage significant server infrastructure to process speech, while Appareo is currently running ATC Transcription on an iPad or iPhone. What’s more, the model is capable of being hosted on other hardware platforms like the nVidia Jetson Nano, or a custom solution manufactured by Appareo (see image below). This allows ATC Transcription to operate outside of network coverage, safely and securely performing its function. Appareo can build a hardware solution to host the ATC Transcription system in a variety of environments, either embed-able inside other avionics or separately packaged in a manner compliant to DO-160 requirements. Possibilities Although Appareo’s training infrastructure has been focused on ATC speech, this infrastructure could be applied to other mission-specific audio information to achieve similar in-vehicle results.

As part of the Stratus family, Appareo offers TSO’d USB chargers. The emergence of Appareo’s certified line of power products was born from experiences with our popular line of Stratus ADS-B receivers. Our customers were worried and concerned for their safety when they began experiencing NAV/COM noise from radio interference caused by their cheap charging electronics. As tablets and smartphones have become more power hungry, customers have been frustrated by their USB chargers being unable to recharge their devices while they are in use. Unfortunately, FAA-certified power chargers were hard for our customers to find at a reasonable price. Appareo began developing, certifying, and deploying power chargers to ensure our customers would have affordable, safe, and reliable access to their EFBs — and ADS-B weather and traffic information from Stratus receivers — while flying. Get the reliability of Stratus, with your own name At Appareo we love solving problems. We recognized an emerging problem for our airframe manufacturer customers — their aircraft feels like a flying advertisement for other companies’ brand names. When considering the delivery of a new aircraft, Appareo believes that aircraft should be wholly representative of our customer’s brand, rather than having Appareo, Stratus, or another avionic manufacturer’s brand competing for the mindshare and experience of that new aircraft customer. To that end, we offer a number of customizations, blank faceplates, or private branding of our popular line of TSO’d USB charger products.

6,"Acoustic Material Flow Sensors - Appareo Industries Aviation Aircraft Communication Units Aviation Speech Recognition System Flight Data Monitoring Stratus by Appareo USB Power Charging Ag & Construction Acoustic Material Flow Sensors Cellular Asset Trackers Electronic Motor and Hydraulic Control Global Data and Device Management iPad Based Machine Control and Monitoring Smart Cameras and Optics Telematic Control Units Services Engineering Product Development Manufacturing About Support Blog Careers Select Page Acoustic Material Flow Sensors Effectively measure material flow in the most challenging and important environments. Appareo is a pioneer in the development of acoustic material flow sensors. Our flow sensors are excellent at measuring the flow of pneumatically driven granular particles. Appareo’s Flow Sensors For operations where granular material like seed or fertilizer is being propelled by air through a system, being dragged through a system, or falling through a system, Appareo sensors provide a robust way to reliably measure the material’s flow. This capability can be deployed in manners that are not invasive and is especially useful in very challenging environments like: Dust-ridden or cloudy environments Caustic or corrosive environments Very high vibration environments For many applications in which Appareo has deployed sensors like this, it has previously not been possible to deploy an effective, accurate, and cost-effective sensor to monitor important machine functions. Technology Application Although currently used in agricultural applications, these sensors could also be used to measure the flow of other particles like aggregates. The sensors themselves are purely mechanical and contain no moving parts. These sensors are designed much like a stethoscope, with a surface that the material impacts, an auditory tube leading back to the electronics, and a microphone within the electronics that measures the energy transferred by material striking the surface of the sensor. Appareo’s signal processing expertise is leveraged to process these sensor inputs in ways that allow the sensors to be used in a broad range of sensing applications without requiring recalibration, despite changes in particle size and speed. Examples for the utilization of this sensing principle to solve challenging monitoring and control problems is discussed in three different examples below: Seed and Fertilizer Flow Sensing in Pneumatic Seed Drills or Air Seeders, Material Sensing in Combines, and High-Flow Fertilizer Flow Sensing in Self-Propelled Spreaders. Seed and Fertilizer Flow Sensing in Pneumatic Seed Drills or Air Seeders In one embodiment of this sensing principle, Appareo designed a material flow sensor for Intelligent Ag Solutions. This sensor is used to measure the flow of seed and/or fertilizer through an air seeder. The sensor ensures that the seed and fertilizer reaches the ground and no impediments in the airstream cause uneven distribution or blockage of material. In this application, the sensor is a significant improvement in reliability over electro optical sensors because fertilizer (which wants to absorb water and cake onto sensors) and dust can accumulate throughout the machine during the season in which it operates. This fouls traditional optical sensors, causing false or missed readings. This sensor has been very successful and reliable in this challenging environment. Material Sensing in Combines Appareo’s expertise has been further leveraged in the implementation of energy sensing acoustic sensors to measure the flow of grain, and material other than grain (MOG), through a combine harvester’s processing and separation systems. Automation of grain harvesting systems has always been challenging because the process of separating the grain from the rest of the plant matter is messy, making the environment inside of the harvester very difficult for sensors. The plants are cut, conveyed into the combine, beaten, and then run through a centrifugal separation process that flings grain and plant material out at high speed. Understanding how far through that separation system the plant material is traveling before the grain is separated is key to minimizing harvesting loss. These sensors, which are highlighted in this video from AGCO, are positioned throughout the separation system. The sensors, in their design, construction, and material selection, are optimized to sense the strikes of the seeds against the membranes of the sensor, providing a good signal-to-noise ratio, despite the amount of plant matter also moving through the combine harvester. Further, Appareo developed the mechanics of the sensor to produce a signal output that is significantly outside of the noise profile of the machine itself, ensuring that the machine noise does not pollute the sensor signal. High-Flow Fertilizer Flow Sensing in Self-Propelled Spreaders Measurement of fertilizer is an important and challenging thing to do in agricultural applications. Fertilizer is highly corrosive and is hydrophilic, meaning that it wants to absorb water. When it does — for example, in high humidity air — it will stick to things and rapidly begin to corrode many materials. Some fertilizer is spread using self-propelled machines that are commonly referred to as floaters. These machines drive quickly over the ground while fans propel material through an airstream against a deflector, which spreads the granular fertilizer on top of the ground. The machines can operate over a very broad spectrum of rates and speeds, requiring a sensing solution that can handle a large range of signals in a very challenging working environment. To solve this problem, Appareo developed a sensor that adheres to the back of the deflector, named Recon SpreadSense. This approach allows the sensor to easily be retrofitted to machines, does not disrupt the normal flow and distribution of material, and provides a high quality flow signal. The sensor measures the transfer of energy from fertilizer striking the deflector and the resultant signal is read by Appareo-designed electronics and broadcast to a monitor in the cab of the machine. This allows the machine operator to effectively monitor the proper operation of the machine, ensuring fertilizer is properly applied to maximize crop yield.

Using a microphone inside of the camera system, the sensor learns the paddle pass frequency of the clean grain elevator and times the illumination of the sample to capture data as the grain is flung from the paddle of the clean grain elevator. This unique capability allows for more flexibility in the sensor’s mounting location, with capabilities to be located in areas where material may be moving quickly through the harvester. The optical data is presented to a processor for algorithms, either conventional or machine-learning based, to evaluate the amount of cracked grain and material other than grain (MOG) in the sample. Information on the quality of the grain sample can then be sent over CAN bus or Ethernet to other electronic devices or for presentation to the user. Although only used currently to detect crackedness and material other than grain, Appareo has successfully demonstrated the ability to detect other grain properties, like moisture, on this sensor as well. Identification of Grain Types using Smart Optical Sensors Appareo developed a grain classification sensor for a customer. This sensor, which is IEC and ATEX certified for use in explosive grain dust environments, captures images of a scene and classifies them as one of 13 different crop types, unknown, or empty. Within the sub-types of crops, the system can identify which are crops of very high similarity (e.g. confectionary vs. oilseed sunflower, red vs. white wheat, etc.). The sensor runs a custom convolutional neural network that was iteratively created to yield the optimal performance for the least computation in order to execute real-time on the camera. In addition to developing the algorithms on the sensor, Appareo also developed the hardware and executed the explosive atmospheric certification work. Identification of Shape Differences Among a Class of Materials Among optical sensors, identifying variations within a similar class of materials, that are a similar color, can be a challenging technical problem. It’s been investigated and determined that Appareo’s algorithms and smart sensors are capable of overcoming this problem. One example of this problem is the identification of strawberry shape. Strawberries that are conical are capable of being run through roller systems to align the berries in a way that they could be processed (e.g. topped by a water jet to remove the greens). Other berry shapes, such as wedges and rounds cannot be easily aligned by roller systems. Up to this point, however, it has not been possible to quickly identify one shape of strawberry versus another to enable their effective sorting during processing and packaging. After considering a number of features that could potentially be used to discriminate between shape types, Appareo developed a deep neural network that used a combination of features that significantly outperformed the state of the art. 1810 NDSU Research Cir.

Connectivity and Processing Capabilities Appareo TCUs are well-suited for the diagnostics hub of a machine, allowing updating of ECUs, remote diagnostics, remote command and configuration, and offloading of machine data. Appareo offers globally certified devices for cellular communication and has partnered with carriers and test facilities to deliver network certifications in historically challenging countries like Brazil and Russia. LAN Capabilities In addition to the wide area network (WAN) cellular and satellite connectivity capabilities of Appareo’s Gateways, most Appareo telematic products also feature local area network (LAN) capabilities . These capabilities allow equipment operators to interact with their machines through mobile applications for either control or monitoring purposes. Appareo is one of the few companies in the world deploying control solutions for control of agricultural or construction machinery using Wi-Fi as the control interface, leveraging these telematic control units. These applications are at times made easier for the operator by the Appareo Grip iPad Controller. Additionally, these LAN interfaces allow the machine to recognize beacon or asset trackers (like the Appareo AT-40), communicate with sensors, receive or transmit data for M2M purposes, and more. For customers seeking global connectivity without limitations, Appareo is an Iridium® value-added manufacturer and value-added reseller — integrating Iridium capabilities at both a module and chip-level in Gateway series products. Customizable Appareo’s line of telematic products feature up to six CAN buses, serial communications (e.g. RS-232), Digital I/O, Ethernet, and BroadR-Reach. Appareo products are designed for rugged environments, with IP67 or IP69K ratings, while also conforming to the challenging environmental requirements of our large equipment Not seeing the exact I/O you require for your application? Contact Appareo to find out how we can modify one of our Gateway series products to meet the needs of your equipment. Open Platform Appareo’s telematic products are built on a popular distribution of embedded Linux (Yocto) with Docker support that allows developers to quickly deploy applications, whether that software be written by your in-house team or by Appareo on your behalf. In addition, hardware-abstraction libraries are provided to provide easy porting to variants of hardware platforms. This capability is important to keep engineering overhead minimized as our customers deploy new telematic devices to take advantage of new generations of cellular technology (e.g. 3G, 4G, 5G). As new variants of our telematic products are released to accommodate technology improvements the same abstractions can be used to run on multiple platforms. These libraries also allow for rapid development of custom applications to be run on Appareo Gateways. Hardware abstraction libraries exist in C/C++, but Python, Rush, Google Go, and .NET and can all be run on Appareo Gateways.

As part of the celebration, we’ve been hosting events for our team members at Appareo. On Wednesday, August 16, we held a corn feed for our employees. Rather than going to a large chain grocery store to purchase cobs of corn, we decided to utilize a local farm in our area. Driscoll Farms is a third-generation family-owned farm near the Fargo-Moorhead metro. They have been providing flowers and produce for the community for 57 years. Did you know that Minnesota is the second largest sweet corn producer in the US? The Support Continues The support for our community’s farmers didn’t stop there. A member of our team had an amazing group of neighbors get together to husk all of the corn. After the group was done shucking them, they took the husks out to a local farmer to use as feed for their show pigs and show goats. We are thrilled to support local farmers while also celebrating our company and culture with our employees. 1810 NDSU Research Cir.
