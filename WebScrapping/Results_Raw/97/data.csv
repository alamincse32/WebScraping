IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog Does your construction project call for specialty wood? So did Happy Harry’s Bottle Shop… This project required over 11-1/2 miles of Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar for the interior of their 20,000 sq. ft. award winning bottle shop in Fargo, North Dakota. We sourced an A & better Western Red Cedar paneling from one of our Western Canadian partners. Happy Harry’s chose to use our ⁷⁄₁₆” x 6″ tongue and groove pattern with a fine line V for character. The tally ran 3″ to 20′ and the mill packaged it in six piece bundles for safety while shipping. Ledgestone Inc., located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, did a superb job of installing the paneling and Happy Harry’s was very satisfied. We were proud to be chosen as a key supplier for this project. If your construction project calls for specialty wood of any kind, please give Mr. Spindle a call. Here is more information on Specialty Wood Sourcing.

Curve Handrails Historic Tourist Attractions Specialty Wood Sourcing Specialty Wood Sourcing Happy Harry’s Bottle Shop About Us Go Green! IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog The goal of the Mr. Spindle company is to give its customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price. Our vast array of spindles, balusters, porch posts, newel posts, columns, custom turnings, finials, handrails, and post tops are produced from the world’s finest cedar, redwood, Brazilian IPE, and American pine. Our products will help you create the porch or deck your family will enjoy for years to come. Mr. Spindle also has an assortment of interior products also. We have been selling Cedar boards since 1977. We came into the manufacturing side of the industry in 1988 when our board company realized we had customers looking for Cedar decking and porch components. That is when Mr. Spindle was born. We started with a hand full of parts being produced and since evolved into a company which produces about 400 different products with additional products being added each day. Custom turning and restoration jobs have been a strong part of that addition to our line over the last 10 years. Custom jobs enable us to add about 2-3 parts per week. Send us your picture and we can see if we’ve manufactured it before and if not we will add it to our library of products at a reasonable price. We have so many styles that are not pictured. Don’t settle for something when restoring history! Quality Mr. Spindle stands by the quality of its products. If there is a problem, please let us know within 72 hours of receiving your product. Cedar is a very soft wood and if left on the jobsite for an extended period of time, it may become damaged. We do not want to be responsible for those situations. On very limited occasions, we do come across some defected material that doesn’t get caught in our double check process (sanding and boxing). Send us pictures, send us an email, call us, we won’t leave you out in the woods. Some spindles get made in about 30 seconds which doesn’t give us a great deal of time to hand sand and inspect the parts. If you purchase treated material, that pressure treating can do some amazing things to a piece of wood. Our treated material is air dried prior to manufacturing so stability should not be a problem. Mother nature on the other hand, does some strange things which we cannot prevent. Ultimately, the goal of the Mr. Spindle company is to give it’s customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price. We hope to help you create a recreational backyard environment which can be enjoyed by your family for years to come by utilizing what was once waste wood in the forests of America. History Being a family owned small business, the Matthews family has strived to establish the Mr. Spindle company as the benchmark for quality and on time delivery in the decking components industry. Since 1988, our company has continued to grow producing better and easier to use products. We are proudly selling across America. Initially using the traditional high volume copy lathes, we have evolved with state of the art computer controlled lathes and CNC tables so that today we can mimic or reproduce most any style turning you can imagine. Until early in 2020, there were two custom turning companies in North Dakota, Cinder Whit & Company (cinderwhit.com) located in Wahpeton and Mr. Spindle, Inc. located in Fargo. Cinder Whit is no longer in business. We, at Mr. Spindle, have been turning similar products as Cinder Whit for over 30 years and would be happy to earn your business. Shipping Our stock items generally ship within two days with most orders shipping that same day or next day. Our custom orders usually ship within five to seven days. Custom work is most dependent on how busy the lathe is and how many parts you are ordering. We can lock that down when you call to place your order! We ship most often with FedEx Ground, Home Delivery, Freight or SpeeDee Delivery. Upon request, the tracking number can be emailed to you so you can track your package to your front door. We also offer next day and two day delivery upon request if you are in a hurry. Unfortunately, that is the price you pay for procrastination! Payment We accept personal or company checks, debit cards and major credits cards. We do require payment in full prior to manufacturing and shipping your order unless you have an account and previous purchase history. There is a 3.5% credit card processing fee that will be billed directly to your card from the card processing company. Returns Shopping by phone has its benefits. Returns are minimal since we take the order over the phone and we make sure what you want will work for your application. Every case is dealt with on an individual basis but our standard is a 20% restocking fee but may be higher based on the style/size of spindles and you pay for shipping both ways. Custom orders are non refundable unless it is our mistake. That is why we take every step possible to ensure that your custom part is made to your specifications.

IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog Using Renewable Wood Resources Our customers might notice we use the shorter lengths available in cedar and redwood for our products. By using lengths down to 5″ pieces of fiber for our post caps and in our finger jointing program, we have helped develop an industry that is now using what was once scrap lumber. Truly a renewable resource, cedar and redwood manufacturers are now using everything, including the saw dust … Please use our products with the knowledge that our industry is truly “GREEN.” Thank you! Cedar Cedar has become a preferred wood for interiors and exteriors of both residential and commercial buildings. Its versatility and appeal to several architectural designs make it one of today’s more requested softwoods. Even though cedar is fairly light weight, quality conscious builders choose this material for its strength. It’s the perfect choice to be used throughout a building’s structure. Cedar has a built-in natural preservative which resists decay and deterioration, making it an ideal light framing material for fencing and decking. As the production of cedar continues to increase, responsible logging practices continue to improve. Western Red Cedar is a very tolerant tree … it suffers little from insect attack. Cedar can be grown in shady conditions, thrives in favorable conditions and can withstand strong winds due to its fully developed root system and large buttresses. There is about 44 billion board feet of Western Red Cedar sawtimber on commercial timberland in the United States. Oregon and Washington have more than half of this volume. An estimated 8.7 billion cubic feet of growing stock occurs in Washington, Idaho, Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California. Redwood Redwood’s versatile beauty and durability have made it one of today’s classic building materials. It’s one wood that is appealing in any architectural style, whether it be a traditional residential home or a contemporary office building. Redwood is unmatched in its long lasting elegant appearance by any other wood species or synthetic building materials including woods treated with chemicals. The advantages of using redwood for exterior applications have been known for many years. The inherent natural chemicals it contains gives redwood a unique resistance to weather and insect causing decay. This makes it a perfect choice for decks, fences and shelters. Some of redwood’s other characteristics include its resistance to shrinking, warping, checking and its ability to hold a variety of finishes because of its dimensional stability. Many people assume because of the overwhelming size of the redwood tree they are irreplaceable and should be protected from harvesting. When in reality the redwood is the best protected tree in the United States. The Society of American Foresters estimates there are more coastal redwoods in existance today than when logging began in the region. Today, California is home to more than 1.7 million acres of redwood forests. The Society estimated that coastal redwoods occupied no more than 100,000 acres of forestlands in 1964. This total area increased to 181,000 acres in 1978. Today, more than 400,000 acres are set aside in public parks, reserves, campgrounds, wilderness areas and nature study areas for public use. These massive redwoods are proud to hold the record for being the tallest trees in the world. Spectacular old-growth groves are typically found at the mouths of rivers and where centuries of periodic flooding deposited layers of nutrient-rich soils. Virtually all old-growth trees are protected from harvest, and forestry companies invest millions of dollars to improve water quality throughout the redwood region. Redwoods are also the fastest growing commercial softwood trees in the United States. Trees that are four to ten years old normally grow two to six feet per year. Redwood lumber comes from privately owned, second- and third-generation forests which have raised sustainable forestry to new levels. With active management, forest-regeneration and continued conservation, we will be blessed with more redwoods in the near future than we currently have today. Thuja plicata Thuja plicata, commonly called Western or Pacific redcedar, giant or western arborvitae, giant cedar, or shinglewood, is a species of Thuja, an evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae native to western North America. Despite its common names, it does not belong with the true cedars within the genus Cedrus. It is the Provincial tree of British Columbia, and has extensive applications for the indigenous First Nations of the Pacific Northwest. Western Redcedar is among the most widespread trees in the Pacific Northwest, and is associated with Douglas-fir and western hemlock in most places where it grows. It is found at the elevation range of sea level to a maximum of 2290 m above sea level at Crater Lake in Oregon. In addition to growing in lush forests and mountainsides, Western Redcedar is also a riparian tree, and grows in many forested swamps and streambanks in its range. The tree is shade-tolerant, and able to reproduce under dense shade. It has been introduced to other temperate zones, including western Europe, Australia (at least as far north as Sydney), New Zealand, the eastern United States (at least as far north as Central New York), and higher elevations of Hawaii. Thujaplicin Thujaplicin, a chemical substance, is found in mature trees and serves as a natural fungicide, thereby preventing the wood from rotting. This effect lasts around a century even after the tree is felled. However, thujaplicin is only found in older trees, and saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow, rotten trunk. Uses The soft red-brown timber has a tight, straight grain and few knots. It is valued for its distinct appearance, aroma, and its high natural resistance to decay, being extensively used for outdoor construction in the form of posts, decking, shingles and siding. It is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making beehives. At Mr. Spindle, we love what we do. And it’s important to do that in a way that is responsible. We utilize sustainably sourced wood for our furniture where we can, and we’re proud to take the initiative to do so.

IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog The Folks at Mr. Spindle have teamed up with Timber Holdings USA and their line of Iron Woods® products to create a line of durable, gorgeous IPE spindles. Ipe (Tabebuia spp-Lapacho group) Discover the unique properties that make Iron Woods® Ipe an easy choice for any project. Iron Woods® brand Ipe naturally resists wear, rot, splintering, termites, fire, chemicals, marine borers and virtually every other threat imaginable. And it does it beautifully. Iron Woods® brand Ipe is the benchmark in residential and commercial wood products. Our residential decking is even covered by a 25-year warranty. This Brazilian species is one of the most stable of all the durable timbers. It dries extremely well with little checking, twisting, or bow. It is widely recognized for its strength and natural resistance to decay. It can be used in ground contact without preservatives or additional treatments. The timber has been tested by the US Navy in a Panama Canal study from 1962 showing Ipe to be one of the top performers in resistance to decay, termites, and borers. Of those tested, it was one of the very few that is readily commercially available. Widely used in commercial exterior construction such as boardwalks, piers and benches, it has recently become the best choice for residential decks due to its low maintenance, attractive color, and extremely smooth surface that has stood the test of time. It is a heavy timber, approximately 69lbs. per cubic foot when dry, generally sinks in water, and is fire resistant. Ipe has many common and trade names including Brazilian Walnut, Bethabarra, Tajibo, Mataverde, Pau Lope, and other trademark names. Strength & Durability Iron Woods® Ipe is indeed tough. Ipe from Timber Holdings USA earns the top durability rating of 25 plus years in commercial applications like the Atlantic City boardwalk. Just think how long they will last for you. Iron Woods® Ipe’s amazing performance can be attributed to its incredible density. Ipe weighs as much as 69 pounds per cubic foot. Compare this to domestic woods like Southern Pine at 35 pounds and Redwood at 28 pounds! Timber Holdings USA Iron Woods® Ipe is five times harder. No other wood comes close to its superior strength. A little history on Timber Holdings USA Iron Woods® brand. Timber Holdings USA has been sourcing and supplying naturally durable wood products for over 30 years from around the globe.

IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog Kary/Vickie, I just wanted to send both of you a quick thank you for all your patience and assistance over the past 7 months. We never had a back porch, until this week. We started in January and here it is…. check out those spindles! Not to mention the ipe steps. Again THANKS… you made things easy. Bill Bill Punxsutawney, PA Hi Mr. Spindle You make a great product. I do want to comment, that I was very impressed on the packaging and shipping of the spindles too. All 130 spindles were without blemish (very good finish, no dents, no drying cracks, no scratches, just perfect). That’s is testament to the hard work and passion you have for your product. Keep up the great work! Ben Ben Burlington, WI Kary Remember our order from last summer? We have completed the first half and all went as planned. The quality of materials was outstanding and we are VERY happy the way the deck turned out. Here are a few pictures. We are well on our way painting the remaining millwork and that will be installed next spring. Thanks again for working with us. Bill and Marilyn Bill and Marilyn Hudson, WI Kary I did limit myself to four photos this time. Your work has dazzled all (even the town’s building inspector). Imagine, having all rails and balusters matching! The newel post is such an improvement, and it perfectly reflects the existing porch columns (which required a week of intensive bondo application by a talented carpenter to save them). How you make the newel from a photo is quite the trick. We’re crossing our fingers that some texting driver does’t round the nearby 90-degree turn and take everything out. (But should that happen, we’ll know who to call!) John John Great Barrington, MA All new. They worked great and match perfectly. I could have left some of the old ones but decided not worth it. I left the top and bottom rails so they were drop in. “Original spindles rotted out beyond repair. Home Owners Association did not have a supplier for new spindles but desired a spindle that conformed with other residents. Mr. Spindle provided an affordable drop in replacement in a timely manner.” Doug Doug Columbia, MD In late 2014 I was working on a television show and needed to replicate, exactly, a railing at an old Craftsman home for the set we were building on a sound stage. We searched the internet and could find nothing even remotely resembling the spindles we needed. Our only option was to have them manufactured. As we searched for a manufacturer, I stumbled upon the Mr. Spindle website and read a testimonial that happened to be written by a good friend and fellow construction coordinator in the Atlanta area, John Weeks. I immediately reached out to Mr. Spindle by phone and emailed them a CAD file of the profile the same day. Five days later our order of 95 custom spindles shipped. In mid 2015, we placed a second order with Mr. Spindle for over 200 custom spindles for a feature length film. Once again, it was a positive experience. The product quality, customer service, speed of manufacture, cost and shipping are exemplary. Thanks Mr. Spindle! John Fore Construction Coordinator for film and television. John Fore Spindles look great, Kary – and thanks for the amazingly fast turn-around!! The spindles to the left of the corner of the porch were reproduced by you, those to the right are originals. A real pleasure doing business with you, Joe Joe P. Wilmington, NC I have been in the custom home business for 30 years and its been a great experience working with all the folks at Mr. Spindle. Their attention to detail, quality of products and follow through is second to none.” Follow the link to view more pictures of this project with product from Mr. Spindle: http://public.fotki.com/JohnRino/lake-geneva-rails–/img-4572.html#media Mike Doomis Doomis Custom Builders Every thing was great. I had several conversations with one of your staff and they were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We replicated an original fence as we live in a designated historic district and had to recreate the pre existing 100 year old fence. Again thank you for supplying such a great product. M. Cataldo Salem, MA Thanks again for everything. The porch has character and the quality is unmatched in the neighborhood. The Courchaines in CT Kary, Received the porch post Looks identical to the ones standing. Thanks for your work! Mark R. Mark R.- Lafayette, IN Bob, The four 6X6 Deco Posts arrived this morning. I pulled one out of the box, and it looked great! Please hold that design. Bill and Martha – Winchester, VA First thank you… for all the great products you sold us! Everything was/is as good as it gets! My friend wants a price on 4 handrails (designer) just like you sold us. (2) tops and (2) bottoms. Dick & Mimi Palm Harbor, FL Kary, Posts arrived and are so perfect! I’m super picky and you all did a terrific job! I’ll take a picture when they are installed and forward to you. Thanks! Terri Terri – Glen Ellyn, IL Hello, My name is John Weeks and I’m the Construction Coordinator on ABC Television’s “Resurrection”. During our recent construction of the front porch of a new stage set, we ran into a bit of trouble matching the spindles of a house that we had previously shot on a location. We HAD to find the spindles fast. I called my usual suppliers to no avail. They were either going to take too long or be too expensive. In desperation I Googled, found, and called Mr. Spindle. I sent them a drawing, they had a very close match and we were off to the races. Here’s the cool part: They turned almost a hundred of them the next day before we even had time to set up an account. Three days later (again, before the account was even set up) the product arrived on a pallet. I cannot say enough good things about this company. The quality of the work, the trust they extended me, and the speed with which they shipped them to me was outstanding. The price more than offset our desire to order within the state of Georgia, which we have to do to utilize a state tax incentive on purchases. I have told many other buyers around here about Mr. Spindle and will continue to do so. Please take this as a ringing endorsement of this fine company. I very rarely get the chance to say that, believe me. John Weeks – Construction Coordinator on ABC Television’s “Resurrection” Disney ABC Television Stone Mountain, GA Kary, The porch post look great. Thank you for your time getting them just right. Come spring I’ll get back in touch as I have a whole bunch of spindles to do. Best Regards, Matt Matt – Buffalo, NY Hello Mr. Spindle Team, The post arrived in record time and we have been busy as bees, getting them ready to go up! I just wanted to say that I think they are beautiful! We were really shocked to get them so fast and I want to thank you again for our wonderful cedar post. Hope you have a great rest of the year, and throughout the holidays coming! Blessings on you and yours. The Crafts – Dubach, LA Hi Kary, We received the finials. They are perfect. Thank you. Lois – Merrick, NY Hi Kary Thought I’d show you how my post caps and finials turned out. Totally awesome!! We will be putting in a picket fence in the future. I’m mentioning this because I’d like to order 20 mire finials and caps when it’s time. Hi Kary, Thank you for your help again, there are many “Mr. Spindle” balusters around Elgin on porches we have built and you guys have always done first-class work! http://www.facebook.com/allaroundhomeimprovements www.allaroundhomeimprovements.net Scott Savel All Around Home Improvement Thank you so much. You your attention to detail is unmatched. With little prep, I was able to paint and install the ball top post caps! Andrew Eisman Well the spindles were delivered this week and they are just perfect! Not sure how you got such a perfect match but they are exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you! Erin Sibley I am a carpenter aficionado and for this project (a coffee table) it took me a while to find the right legs. That was my fault, I mean my fault because I didn’t look in the right place. Now, after finding Mr. Spindle, it is the first and only place I look. Forget about the gorgeous online catalog they have. What really got me is the personalized attention, guidance and professionalism from my first inquiry to delivery which made the process a breeze. Thanks guys! E. Gonzalez I started searching online and came across Mr. Spindle . And here is where we get excited. Not only are the folks at Mr. Spindle pleasant to deal with and knowledgeable about their products, but also they are up to the task of reproducing my baluster at a VERY decent price. Read my blog @ http://fairytoon.blogspot.com/2012/04/near-perfect-match.html Carlie Quality product and excellent finish provided in a timely fashion, superb communication through out the process! A+ David Shapiro www.dishapiro.com I have a house built in 1907, and I wanted something special for the front stairs and front porch. I sent Mr. Spindle photos of the balusters on my sleeping porch and they not only matched them, but did so at a considerably better price than I could buy non custom locally here on Long Island. I also wanted a special newel post and extra large hand rails, all of which were expertly done and delivered in a very reasonable time. If you are looking for a great product, at a fair price, and something you will be proud to have in or part of your home, this is the place to go! W. Russell Corker, Esq. Law Office of W. Russell Corker, PC Huntington, NY Just want to say thanks for “embracing ” the opportunity to do an odd size baluster for us. The customer was so thrilled to get what they specified and I now have a great new resource for turnings! Ann Miller Greenfield Millworks Kary, they turned out really great. I have already recommended you guys to a couple friends! Thanks for all the help. Top notch, professional and very reasonably priced job. Eric Doerr Seattle, WA. Mr. Spindle helped us make custom balusters that turned out exactly the way we imagined. We couldn’t be happier with the finished product!

IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog Does your construction project call for specialty wood? So did Happy Harry’s Bottle Shop… This project required over 11-1/2 miles of Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar for the interior of their 20,000 sq. ft. award winning bottle shop in Fargo, North Dakota. We sourced an A & better Western Red Cedar paneling from one of our Western Canadian partners. Happy Harry’s chose to use our ⁷⁄₁₆” x 6″ tongue and groove pattern with a fine line V for character. The tally ran 3″ to 20′ and the mill packaged it in six piece bundles for safety while shipping. Ledgestone Inc., located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, did a superb job of installing the paneling and Happy Harry’s was very satisfied. We were proud to be chosen as a key supplier for this project. If your construction project calls for specialty wood of any kind, please give Mr. Spindle a call. Here is more information on Specialty Wood Sourcing.

Or do you have a historic home that requires special attention, so the railing system helps to maintain historical accuracy? Wait no longer for your vision to become a reality. Have your architect draw up the plans and send them to us. Mr. Spindle will carefully manufacture the custom curved handrails and any other decking components needed, bringing your ideas to life. Make the outdoors your favorite place to relax and enjoy in every season. At Mr. Spindle, we not only enjoy creating high-quality products, but we also enjoy the wonderful clients we work with. Recently, we had the pleasure of dealing with Mike Doomis of Doomis Custom Builders from Carpentersville, Illinois, on this new construction project in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Mike emailed us the blueprints. The architect for the project is Stan Leonard Designs, Inc. from Downers Grove, Illinois. We followed up with a quote for the requested rails. Upon approval, Mr. Spindle then manufactured these beautiful custom curved handrails. We tapered the tops of shoe rails and notched the spindle bottoms to match. This allows the railings to shed water, helping prevent rot. The homeowners chose our 4×4 Albany spindles. To complete the order, we also supplied the newels along with porch posts for the front of the house. The entire order was delivered on schedule. Before leaving the construction site, Bob assembled some of the railing to check the radius and everything fit perfectly. Thanks Mike, it was a great working with you and Steve! I have been in the custom home business for 30 years and its been a great experience working with all the folks at Mr. Spindle. Their attention to detail, quality of products and follow through is second to none.” Mike Doomis Doomis Custom Builders Our Products 4"" Finials & Ball Tops 6"" & Larger Finials & Ball Tops 4"" & Larger Fence & Deck Post Caps 6"" & Larger Fence & Deck Post Caps 4x4 Newels & Decos 6x6 Newels & Decos Porch Accent Spindles 2x2 & 3x3 Spindles & Palings 3x3 Spindles & Palings 4x4 Spindles & Palings 6x6 Spindles & Palings Balusters Porch Posts & Columns Handrails “Handyman Forgiveness” Kits Log Home Railings Our Catalog Contact Us Mr. Spindle 4039 98th Ave S.

Curve Handrails Historic Tourist Attractions Specialty Wood Sourcing Specialty Wood Sourcing Happy Harry’s Bottle Shop About Us Go Green! IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog The goal of the Mr. Spindle company is to give its customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price. Our vast array of spindles, balusters, porch posts, newel posts, columns, custom turnings, finials, handrails, and post tops are produced from the world’s finest cedar, redwood, Brazilian IPE, and American pine. Our products will help you create the porch or deck your family will enjoy for years to come. Mr. Spindle also has an assortment of interior products also. We have been selling Cedar boards since 1977. We came into the manufacturing side of the industry in 1988 when our board company realized we had customers looking for Cedar decking and porch components. That is when Mr. Spindle was born. We started with a hand full of parts being produced and since evolved into a company which produces about 400 different products with additional products being added each day. Custom turning and restoration jobs have been a strong part of that addition to our line over the last 10 years. Custom jobs enable us to add about 2-3 parts per week. Send us your picture and we can see if we’ve manufactured it before and if not we will add it to our library of products at a reasonable price. We have so many styles that are not pictured. Don’t settle for something when restoring history! Quality Mr. Spindle stands by the quality of its products. If there is a problem, please let us know within 72 hours of receiving your product. Cedar is a very soft wood and if left on the jobsite for an extended period of time, it may become damaged. We do not want to be responsible for those situations. On very limited occasions, we do come across some defected material that doesn’t get caught in our double check process (sanding and boxing). Send us pictures, send us an email, call us, we won’t leave you out in the woods. Some spindles get made in about 30 seconds which doesn’t give us a great deal of time to hand sand and inspect the parts. If you purchase treated material, that pressure treating can do some amazing things to a piece of wood. Our treated material is air dried prior to manufacturing so stability should not be a problem. Mother nature on the other hand, does some strange things which we cannot prevent. Ultimately, the goal of the Mr. Spindle company is to give it’s customers the very best outdoor decking components available at any price. We hope to help you create a recreational backyard environment which can be enjoyed by your family for years to come by utilizing what was once waste wood in the forests of America. History Being a family owned small business, the Matthews family has strived to establish the Mr. Spindle company as the benchmark for quality and on time delivery in the decking components industry. Since 1988, our company has continued to grow producing better and easier to use products. We are proudly selling across America. Initially using the traditional high volume copy lathes, we have evolved with state of the art computer controlled lathes and CNC tables so that today we can mimic or reproduce most any style turning you can imagine. Until early in 2020, there were two custom turning companies in North Dakota, Cinder Whit & Company (cinderwhit.com) located in Wahpeton and Mr. Spindle, Inc. located in Fargo. Cinder Whit is no longer in business. We, at Mr. Spindle, have been turning similar products as Cinder Whit for over 30 years and would be happy to earn your business. Shipping Our stock items generally ship within two days with most orders shipping that same day or next day. Our custom orders usually ship within five to seven days. Custom work is most dependent on how busy the lathe is and how many parts you are ordering. We can lock that down when you call to place your order! We ship most often with FedEx Ground, Home Delivery, Freight or SpeeDee Delivery. Upon request, the tracking number can be emailed to you so you can track your package to your front door. We also offer next day and two day delivery upon request if you are in a hurry. Unfortunately, that is the price you pay for procrastination! Payment We accept personal or company checks, debit cards and major credits cards. We do require payment in full prior to manufacturing and shipping your order unless you have an account and previous purchase history. There is a 3.5% credit card processing fee that will be billed directly to your card from the card processing company. Returns Shopping by phone has its benefits. Returns are minimal since we take the order over the phone and we make sure what you want will work for your application. Every case is dealt with on an individual basis but our standard is a 20% restocking fee but may be higher based on the style/size of spindles and you pay for shipping both ways. Custom orders are non refundable unless it is our mistake. That is why we take every step possible to ensure that your custom part is made to your specifications.

IPE Closeout Specials Store Locator Industry Partners Contact Testimonials Blog Kary/Vickie, I just wanted to send both of you a quick thank you for all your patience and assistance over the past 7 months. We never had a back porch, until this week. We started in January and here it is…. check out those spindles! Not to mention the ipe steps. Again THANKS… you made things easy. Bill Bill Punxsutawney, PA Hi Mr. Spindle You make a great product. I do want to comment, that I was very impressed on the packaging and shipping of the spindles too. All 130 spindles were without blemish (very good finish, no dents, no drying cracks, no scratches, just perfect). That’s is testament to the hard work and passion you have for your product. Keep up the great work! Ben Ben Burlington, WI Kary Remember our order from last summer? We have completed the first half and all went as planned. The quality of materials was outstanding and we are VERY happy the way the deck turned out. Here are a few pictures. We are well on our way painting the remaining millwork and that will be installed next spring. Thanks again for working with us. Bill and Marilyn Bill and Marilyn Hudson, WI Kary I did limit myself to four photos this time. Your work has dazzled all (even the town’s building inspector). Imagine, having all rails and balusters matching! The newel post is such an improvement, and it perfectly reflects the existing porch columns (which required a week of intensive bondo application by a talented carpenter to save them). How you make the newel from a photo is quite the trick. We’re crossing our fingers that some texting driver does’t round the nearby 90-degree turn and take everything out. (But should that happen, we’ll know who to call!) John John Great Barrington, MA All new. They worked great and match perfectly. I could have left some of the old ones but decided not worth it. I left the top and bottom rails so they were drop in. “Original spindles rotted out beyond repair. Home Owners Association did not have a supplier for new spindles but desired a spindle that conformed with other residents. Mr. Spindle provided an affordable drop in replacement in a timely manner.” Doug Doug Columbia, MD In late 2014 I was working on a television show and needed to replicate, exactly, a railing at an old Craftsman home for the set we were building on a sound stage. We searched the internet and could find nothing even remotely resembling the spindles we needed. Our only option was to have them manufactured. As we searched for a manufacturer, I stumbled upon the Mr. Spindle website and read a testimonial that happened to be written by a good friend and fellow construction coordinator in the Atlanta area, John Weeks. I immediately reached out to Mr. Spindle by phone and emailed them a CAD file of the profile the same day. Five days later our order of 95 custom spindles shipped. In mid 2015, we placed a second order with Mr. Spindle for over 200 custom spindles for a feature length film. Once again, it was a positive experience. The product quality, customer service, speed of manufacture, cost and shipping are exemplary. Thanks Mr. Spindle! John Fore Construction Coordinator for film and television. John Fore Spindles look great, Kary – and thanks for the amazingly fast turn-around!! The spindles to the left of the corner of the porch were reproduced by you, those to the right are originals. A real pleasure doing business with you, Joe Joe P. Wilmington, NC I have been in the custom home business for 30 years and its been a great experience working with all the folks at Mr. Spindle. Their attention to detail, quality of products and follow through is second to none.” Follow the link to view more pictures of this project with product from Mr. Spindle: http://public.fotki.com/JohnRino/lake-geneva-rails–/img-4572.html#media Mike Doomis Doomis Custom Builders Every thing was great. I had several conversations with one of your staff and they were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We replicated an original fence as we live in a designated historic district and had to recreate the pre existing 100 year old fence. Again thank you for supplying such a great product. M. Cataldo Salem, MA Thanks again for everything. The porch has character and the quality is unmatched in the neighborhood. The Courchaines in CT Kary, Received the porch post Looks identical to the ones standing. Thanks for your work! Mark R. Mark R.- Lafayette, IN Bob, The four 6X6 Deco Posts arrived this morning. I pulled one out of the box, and it looked great! Please hold that design. Bill and Martha – Winchester, VA First thank you… for all the great products you sold us! Everything was/is as good as it gets! My friend wants a price on 4 handrails (designer) just like you sold us. (2) tops and (2) bottoms. Dick & Mimi Palm Harbor, FL Kary, Posts arrived and are so perfect! I’m super picky and you all did a terrific job! I’ll take a picture when they are installed and forward to you. Thanks! Terri Terri – Glen Ellyn, IL Hello, My name is John Weeks and I’m the Construction Coordinator on ABC Television’s “Resurrection”. During our recent construction of the front porch of a new stage set, we ran into a bit of trouble matching the spindles of a house that we had previously shot on a location. We HAD to find the spindles fast. I called my usual suppliers to no avail. They were either going to take too long or be too expensive. In desperation I Googled, found, and called Mr. Spindle. I sent them a drawing, they had a very close match and we were off to the races. Here’s the cool part: They turned almost a hundred of them the next day before we even had time to set up an account. Three days later (again, before the account was even set up) the product arrived on a pallet. I cannot say enough good things about this company. The quality of the work, the trust they extended me, and the speed with which they shipped them to me was outstanding. The price more than offset our desire to order within the state of Georgia, which we have to do to utilize a state tax incentive on purchases. I have told many other buyers around here about Mr. Spindle and will continue to do so. Please take this as a ringing endorsement of this fine company. I very rarely get the chance to say that, believe me. John Weeks – Construction Coordinator on ABC Television’s “Resurrection” Disney ABC Television Stone Mountain, GA Kary, The porch post look great. Thank you for your time getting them just right. Come spring I’ll get back in touch as I have a whole bunch of spindles to do. Best Regards, Matt Matt – Buffalo, NY Hello Mr. Spindle Team, The post arrived in record time and we have been busy as bees, getting them ready to go up! I just wanted to say that I think they are beautiful! We were really shocked to get them so fast and I want to thank you again for our wonderful cedar post. Hope you have a great rest of the year, and throughout the holidays coming! Blessings on you and yours. The Crafts – Dubach, LA Hi Kary, We received the finials. They are perfect. Thank you. Lois – Merrick, NY Hi Kary Thought I’d show you how my post caps and finials turned out. Totally awesome!! We will be putting in a picket fence in the future. I’m mentioning this because I’d like to order 20 mire finials and caps when it’s time. Hi Kary, Thank you for your help again, there are many “Mr. Spindle” balusters around Elgin on porches we have built and you guys have always done first-class work! http://www.facebook.com/allaroundhomeimprovements www.allaroundhomeimprovements.net Scott Savel All Around Home Improvement Thank you so much. You your attention to detail is unmatched. With little prep, I was able to paint and install the ball top post caps! Andrew Eisman Well the spindles were delivered this week and they are just perfect! Not sure how you got such a perfect match but they are exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you! Erin Sibley I am a carpenter aficionado and for this project (a coffee table) it took me a while to find the right legs. That was my fault, I mean my fault because I didn’t look in the right place. Now, after finding Mr. Spindle, it is the first and only place I look. Forget about the gorgeous online catalog they have. What really got me is the personalized attention, guidance and professionalism from my first inquiry to delivery which made the process a breeze. Thanks guys! E. Gonzalez I started searching online and came across Mr. Spindle . And here is where we get excited. Not only are the folks at Mr. Spindle pleasant to deal with and knowledgeable about their products, but also they are up to the task of reproducing my baluster at a VERY decent price. Read my blog @ http://fairytoon.blogspot.com/2012/04/near-perfect-match.html Carlie Quality product and excellent finish provided in a timely fashion, superb communication through out the process! A+ David Shapiro www.dishapiro.com I have a house built in 1907, and I wanted something special for the front stairs and front porch. I sent Mr. Spindle photos of the balusters on my sleeping porch and they not only matched them, but did so at a considerably better price than I could buy non custom locally here on Long Island. I also wanted a special newel post and extra large hand rails, all of which were expertly done and delivered in a very reasonable time. If you are looking for a great product, at a fair price, and something you will be proud to have in or part of your home, this is the place to go! W. Russell Corker, Esq. Law Office of W. Russell Corker, PC Huntington, NY Just want to say thanks for “embracing ” the opportunity to do an odd size baluster for us. The customer was so thrilled to get what they specified and I now have a great new resource for turnings! Ann Miller Greenfield Millworks Kary, they turned out really great. I have already recommended you guys to a couple friends! Thanks for all the help. Top notch, professional and very reasonably priced job. Eric Doerr Seattle, WA.

Both are elements of deck and porch railings. A significant difference is that balusters rest on a footing, usually a stair, while spindles attach to a horizontal plank that runs between porch or deck posts.Mr. Spindle makes wood stair balusters that support handrails along porch or deck stairs. Crafted in square or round designs in your choice of cedar or redwood, these wood stair balusters are an essential element of porch or deck stair design. Lengths from 24” to 36”, and in the bullet nose design, up to 42”, are available. Contact Mr. Spindle with any questions about our balusters and how they can enhance your outdoor stairs.
