1,"Pervious Concrete Roller Screed | Pervious Concrete Joint Cutter and Tools Home Products Form-A-Curb Motors Roller Screed Packages Accessories Applications Pervious Sloped Pours Wide Pours Circular Pours Dealers Blog Contact Us call us (USA and International): (+1)701-281-8989 Jobs You Thought Were Impossible Are Just A Screed Away From Possible PERVIOUS It’s beginning to seem that the entire world is going green. With the Lura Screed, and its line of pervious concrete finishing tools, you’ll be ready to grow your own green business. Pervious concrete, also known as “No Fines” or “Permeable” concrete, allows water to flow through it, making it ideal for storm water run-off control and earning LEED certification in most cases. FEATURES & BENEFITS Lightweight: Because it can be filled with water, Lura Screed is ideal when pouring pervious concrete. Each aluminum section weighs only 4.5 lbs. and reaches 11 lbs. when filled with water, giving it ideal compressive weight. This eliminates the need for sandbags or the addition of any extra weight; and because Lura Screed is 1/3 of the weight of most competitor units, our system greatly reduces the risk of crew injuries. It’s important for contractors to recognize that the weight of the screed itself doesn’t matter. Rather, it’s the compressive weight of the system that makes a unit successful. As long as the screed tube is resting on the forms and not floating, crews can’t apply more pressure because the form will resist. Because it stays on the forms, the Lura Screed system applies more pressure than competitor units because it stays on the forms. Exceptional Cutting Ability: But don’t think that lightweight translates to light work. Lura’s unique design provides exceptional cutting ability making it a true workhorse. The riser wheels eliminate friction and make it easier to pull while its unique design and extraordinary cutting ability eliminate all unnecessary manpower. Convenience Because pervious pours are done by panel, riser wheels allow for more convenient application during fill-ins. The riser wheels ensure that the only friction that exists is from the wet pervious concrete, not the screed itself. This eliminated friction translates to an easy to use system for virtually any operator. Durable: Roller screeds are widely viewed as the best method to strike pervious concrete to avoid consolidating and is recommended by the NRMCA. The Lura Screed system compresses the pervious concrete, tightens the aggregate, and enhances the strength and durability of the pervious concrete. RECOMMENDED BY LURA The following are accessories that enhance the success of pervious pours. The Cross Roller: This roller is designed primarily for compaction and is used to create a more durable wear surface. It’s applied as soon as the pervious concrete is leveled. We’ve learned from years of experience that the right way to place pervious is by first, elevating the screed tube, and then rolling it down with the cross roller to compact the top surface. This process is simple and effective. The Joint Cutter: The Joint Cutter, a weighted roller with a cutting wheel, is used to put control joints into the pervious concrete soon after the Cross Roller is used. This prevents cracking in weak areas. Custom cutters are available upon request to suit various thickness requirements. Adjustable Curb Runner: If pervious is being poured up against a sidewalk or a curb, the adjustable curb runner might be necessary. Lura’s patented threaded axle design gives crews the flexibility to be right up against the edge, eliminating a great deal of the hand finishing work that competitor systems leave behind. Painter’s Plastic: Lura incorporates painter’s plastic into their pervious curing process. We do all the work – cross rolling and joint cutting over this plastic immediately after the concrete is struck off. This method saves time and money while also increasing the success rate of the pour. With pervious concrete, it’s hugely important to get the poured concrete covered as quickly as possible. The thin nature of the painter’s plastic allows it to stick to the cement paste, creating a vacuum seal effect. As an added security measure, our team recommends placing 6-mil over the painter’s plastic. The 6-mil is there to protect the painter’s plastic and ensure a proper concrete cure.

2,"Sloped Pours | Pouring Concrete on a Slope Home Products Form-A-Curb Motors Roller Screed Packages Accessories Applications Pervious Sloped Pours Wide Pours Circular Pours Dealers Blog Contact Us call us (USA and International): (+1)701-281-8989 Jobs You Thought Were Impossible Are Just A Screed Away From Possible SLOPED POURS Most paving equipment is designed to place concrete on fairly level surfaces. But the world isn’t flat, and sometimes structures, such as canals or drainage channels, require placing concrete on a slope. The LuraScreed is portable and lightweight, making it ideal for uphill, downhill, and other sloped pours. With competitive systems, working on an incline or slope can be back breaking labor. Those systems often require striking off the concrete going up the slope causing operators to fight not only the weight and friction of the concrete they are striking off, but also the force of gravity. The Lura Screed eliminates that backbreaking labor. We encourage contractors to use our system striking off going down hill and working with the force of gravity. FEATURES & BENEFITS Productivity: With a lightweight design and enhanced features, the Lura Screed enables striking off the pour traveling down the incline, increasing productivity while decreasing crew sizes and maximizing profits. Uniformity: Enhanced concrete uniformity will be evident with each use of the Lura Screed. Our roller screed system's mild compression leaves a smooth surface every time. RECOMMENDED BY LURA Wet Screed Shoe: This feature allows crew to pour right next to wet concrete, making the Lura Screed the only concrete roller screed that floats. Simply attach the wet screed shoe to the handle end in place of the wall plug and attach the ergonomic solid handle to give you total control. For monolithic (continuous or one day) pours, the wet screed shoe is irreplaceable. Center Pin Pivot and Electric Motor: Certain applications such as retention ponds and water treatment ponds require a radius slope. Once a challenge that required placement by hand, radius slopes are easy and efficient with the Lura Screed. With the combination of our center pin pivot and electric motor, contractors can use the roller screed to sweep sideways across the slope.

3,"Wide Concrete Pouring | Screed Large Concrete Pours | Large Concrete Slabs Home Products Form-A-Curb Motors Roller Screed Packages Accessories Applications Pervious Sloped Pours Wide Pours Circular Pours Dealers Blog Contact Us call us (USA and International): (+1)701-281-8989 Jobs You Thought Were Impossible Are Just A Screed Away From Possible WIDE POURS The combination of the Lura Screed’s powerful gas motor and lightweight, easy-to-use design, make it the roller screed system of choice for large, high volume pours. With the flexible and customizable system included in our Contractor Package, and additional extension tubes available for purchase, the Lura Screed system easily manages concrete pours up to 40 feet wide while maintaining a precise and level concrete application. There will be some deflection after 22 feet so in cases where a very flat pour is necessary, wide pours are probably not the way to go. However, for some projects sloping or deflection isn’t going to affect the final outcome. Because of Lura’s threaded axle system, crews have the choice to power up both sides of the screed if necessary in order to tackle a large job, quickly and efficiently. FEATURES & BENEFITS Transportability: Lura’s roller screed is lightweight and extremely portable. It can be lifted by one man and transported in a truck, without the need for an expensive job trailer. Versatility: The Lura Screed's patented threaded axle system accommodates any size of pour. In a snap, the individual sections can be combined to create the ideal length up to 40 feet. RECOMMENDED BY LURA Tips for Success: It’s important to remember that whenever possible, operate your motor off the right side of the screed. In doing so, the natural action of the roller is always “tightening” those threads. If you do move the motor to the left side, use the T-handle wrench to adjust your set screws. In this application, the spinning of the screed will work to “loosen” the thread. The set screw will ensure the screed connection stays firm and your crew should periodically check and tighten it as needed. For pours wider than 24’ the Lura team advises running a screed pipe down the middle of the pour to control any deflection.

With the Lura Screed, circular pours are as easy as 1-2-3 and can be set-up in 10 minutes. A base plate is set into the floor before pouring. The Lura Screed is connected to a shaft placed in the base plate and a center pin is placed into the shaft. Center pin holds the screed to the concrete and allows for one-person circular screeding. When finished, the screed, pin and shaft are removed and a small amount of concrete must be filled in. The base plate remains in place under the concrete. For Crowned or Flat Circular Pours 50ft/15.24m or Larger The Lura Screed's method to strike of circular pours larger than 50ft/15.24m without deflection From Center Pin measure outwards 15ft/4.572m. Pound in re-bar or wood stakes approximately 4.5’ft/ 1.3716m apart around the previously measured 15ft/4.572m from Center Pin. A second person will stand on the outside of the bin pulling the string tight to the outside form. The first person will pound a stake to the appropriate height for yoke system. The other end of the string is fastened to the Center Pin at the predetermined floor height. For each additional stake elevation using a laser level instead of string will ensure accuracy. This process will take 21-24 stakes/Yokes. Lura Enterprises recommends using only Mako or MegaScreed Yoke Systems. Diagram for a large circular pour method (PDF) Features & Benefits Efficient: Circular pours are almost effortless using our center pivot on the inside and form runners on the outside of the screed. Contractors have reported being able to pour 30 foot bin floors with only a two-man crew. User-Friendly: The lightweight design and easy clean-up are just some of the many reasons our contractors prefer the Lura Screed. Competitive units often need multiple crew members with several hours (and sometimes days!) of time spent on the set-up and cleaning process. One man can easily set up or clean up our roller screeds in five minutes or less. Recommended by Lura Enterprises Grain Bin Package Each package includes the powerful and efficient 50cc Honda gas motor, screed section lengths of 20 foot, 12 foot, 6 foot, and 3 foot or 4 foot, our 6 inch wall plug, 3 collapsible tripod set-up stands, 1/8 inch form runner, grain bin bearing, straight metal handle and the accessory tote. In total, this package offers everything needed for grain bin applications in one convenient bundle. The beauty of this bundle is that crews can customize to just about any grain bin pour out there. Center Pin Pivot Replaces the handle of the screed and is adjustable to both height and pitch. This simple invention has revolutionized the way contractors do circular pours by allowing the center to be adjusted to the desired height, while removing the need for a person to operate the non-motor side. The Form Runner Slides over any section of screed tube and rides between the rotation of the screed and the form, preserving the life of the Lura Screed roller.
