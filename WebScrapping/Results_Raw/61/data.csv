StepPLANThere’s a lot to think about when designing a custom kitchen or bathroom. It all begins with your inspiration, and it ends with the perfect countertop installation. Once your design is finalized, drawings are sent to our experienced CSR’s to create an estimate and make needed revisions. After an estimate is signed, our trained scheduling department takes over and assigns tentative template, production, and installation dates. StepMEASURESince no wall is perfectly flat or smooth, capturing an accurate measurement is the first step in creating your new countertops. Our trained experts will visit the installation site and use the latest in technology to create a precise digital template that ensures an exact fit. These templates and measurements are then taken to our engineers who create AutoCAD drawings that are sent to the customer for approval. StepFABRICATEOnce final drawings are approved, our state-of-the-art equipment cuts and polishes your surface, using the digital template as a guide. Skilled craftsmen prepare the final product to meet your custom specifications, which produces a high-quality countertop. StepINSTALLATIONOur team will manage every detail of your installation, working with you to achieve the beautiful results you expect.

Learn more about countertop care below.Laminate CountertopsSolid Surface CountertopsQuartz CountertopsNatural Stone CountertopsNatural Wood CountertopsCultured Marble Vanity TopsGeneral Care Do not place hot items directly on laminate surface. Use a trivet or other protective surface under pots/pans, waffle irons, curing irons, clothing irons, etc. Do not use knives or other sharp utensils that may slice or scratch the laminate surface. Use a cutting board for chopping and slicing. Do not slide abrasive items (such as ceramics) across laminate surface. Use a place mat or protective surface underneath these items. Cleaning For everyday cleaning, use a clean, damp, non-abrasive cloth with a mild detergent or household cleaner. For stuck-on residue, scrub with a nylon bristled brush. For cleaning difficult stains, apply a paste of baking soda and water to draw out the stain. Blot away with a damp cloth – do not rub. Never use cleaners containing acid, alkali, or bleach. General Care Never place hot pans directly from the burner or oven on a solid surface countertop. While solid surface can withstand sustained temperatures up to 225°F, prolonged or extreme heat could cause yellowing. Always use a trivet under heated appliances, such as crock-pots, electric frying pans, etc. Strong acids – like those found in drain, toilet bowl, and oven cleaners – should be used cautiously around solid surfaces. If any of these items come in contact with a solid surface countertop, wipe them up at once. Some of these items, when left on the surface, may cause whitening, which can be difficult to remove. Cleaning Solid surface countertops are nonporous, so everyday cleaning only requires a damp cloth and a mild cleanser. If you’ve chosen a matte finish, feel free to use an abrasive cleaner like Ajax or Comet. However, if you do use an abrasive cleaner, we recommend periodically cleaning the entire surface in a circular motion to maintain uniformity. Some tough spills and stains, such as food dye, tea, and fruit drinks, may require more aggressive cleaning. These common stains can be removed with full-strength bleach, followed by a general cleanser. Bleach should only come in contact with the surface for 2-5 minutes (be sure to rinse your surface with clean water afterwards). On a matte finish, bleach can be avoided by scrubbing with an abrasive cleaner. While solid surface will not burn, if a lit cigarette touches your solid surface countertop, it could leave a nicotine stain or scorch mark. These can be removed by using an abrasive cleaner or buffing in a circular motion with a Scotch-Brite pad. Repairing Scratches For removing superficial scratches, rub in a circular motion with a wet Scotch-Brite hand pad #7448 until the scratches are removed. Clean thoroughly with soap and water, then let dry. Deep scratches can be removed by carefully and lightly sanding with 120-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit and 320-grit sandpaper. After sanding, rub the surface with a wet Scotch-Brite hand pad #7448 in a circular motion to restore the finish. Once the surface is dry, apply a non-wax polish cleaner or other recommended surface dressing for added protection or more luster. Wipe with a clean, dry cloth. Wipe dry using another clean cloth. Severe Damage Should your solid surface countertop sustain a deep gouge, fracture, crack, or any other severe damage, contact us, and a professional countertop fabricator will repair the surface to its original state. General Care Quartz countertops may not withstand the direct and sudden transfer of heat from pots, pans, and other cooking units and heated items. Use a hot pad or trivet underneath these items to prevent damaging your quartz countertop or surface. Whether high, neutral, or low pH, do not expose quartz to abrasive or strong alkaline, acid, or oxidizer cleaner. Avoid abrasive or strong free radicals. Various chemicals are corrosive and/or erosive in their ability to attack any structure, including quartz. Be very aware of these potential damages to your surface. Where there are visible seams in the quartz surface, the product pattern and shade can change. Avoid hitting surfaces with force, as the quartz may chip or crack. Cleaning Do not use or expose quartz countertops to such products including, but not limited to the following: bleach, oven cleaners, Comet, Soft Scrub, SOS, products with pumice, batteries, paint removers, furniture strippers, tarnish, silver cleaners, or similar products. Do not use abrasive or harsh scrub pads. Do not apply any sealers, penetrants, or topical treatments to quartz under any circumstances. These products will wear off and cause the gloss to appear dull or inconsistent. Semi-polished finishes (1cm) will not shine and will soil the countertops. They will appear stained from soiling. General Installation Quartz is not a structural support product. Quartz surfaces with 2cm and 3cm thicknesses are for countertops and must be supported. Quartz with 1cm thickness is for surface finishes such as walls, tub and shower surrounds, and fireplaces. In addition, horizontal applications (such as a tub deck) must be completely supported. Quartz installation is optimized when walls and cabinets are properly prepared for installation. This includes but is not limited to structurally sound, straight, level, and square walls and cabinets. Lack of preparation may cause poor installation, poor seam fit, inconsistent countertop, inconsistent overhang, and inconsistent placement. Disclaimer: Quartz installation does not include qualification of any sink or stove cutouts (any cutouts), faucet hole locations, or cabinet sizes. We are not responsible for verifying if the sink, stove, cutout appliances, cabinets, and faucet hole locations fit together well (or at all). This is the responsibility of the owner and/or general contractor. We will fabricate cutouts per supplied model/template information. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. General Care Do not apply too much weight to any one spot, as this may cause the granite countertop to crack. Do not sit or stand on the countertop’s surface. Also, be observant of what wall decorations hang over the stone countertops. If the hanging decorations are heavy and fall onto the surface, the natural stone may crack under the stress. Always use coasters under cups and drinking glasses. Do not use the countertop as a cutting board, as this may scratch the stone. Always place heat-resistant mats under kitchen or bath appliances, dishes, or china. Regularly dust granite countertops, islands, and vanities. Regularly clean stone surfaces with warm water and a soft cloth, or check with a local Granite Expo for a specialty cleaning agent. Blot spills immediately. Non-evaporating liquids (exg: oils) that are not blotted within 1-2 minutes will stain. Evaporating liquids such as water, wine, and grape juice will temporarily leave a dark spot, but may stain if the stone countertop or surface is not properly sealed. Avoid placing excessive weight on these surfaces. Sitting or standing on them is not recommended. Avoid sudden/rapid changes in temperature as this may cause damage to the surface. Cleaning Granite countertops and surfaces need to be cleaned regularly to maintain their natural sheen and vitality. In the event of a spill, blot the spill with a paper towel immediately. Don’t wipe the area, as this will spread the spill into your countertop. Flush the area with plain water and mild soap, then rinse several times. Dry the area thoroughly with a soft cloth. Repeat as necessary. Clean granite surfaces with a few drops of non-acidic soap scum remover, a mild liquid dishwashing detergent, or denatured alcohol. Use a specialty cleaning agent made for natural stone. These specialty cleaning agents will remove oil, residue, and help clean up everyday food or bath and beauty product spills. Thoroughly rinse and dry the surface after washing. Too much cleaner or soap may leave a film and cause streaks. Do not use products that contain lemon, vinegar, or other acid content that may etch the surface. Do not use abrasive cleaners, such as dry cleaners or soft cleansers. Do not use cleaners that contain acids such as bathroom cleaners, grout cleaners, or tile cleaners. Do not apply acetone or any type of paint thinner. Keep in mind that spills of certain chemicals – especially acids or alkali products – will permanently stain the stone. Therefore, it is important to consider sealing granite countertops and surfaces for an extra layer of protection and to carefully observe prevention measures. Do not mix bleach and ammonia. This combination creates a toxic and lethal gas. Frequent or over-use of soap scum remover could result in dulling the surface of the stone. Sealing Re-application of sealer is recommended after 1-2 years, which can be easily done at home. Different types of natural stone surfaces require different resealing frequency. All-natural stone is porous and should be sealed before use. Sealing will make the granite surface more durable against wear and tear. Sealer comes in water-based or oil-based variants and can have a natural or glossy finish. Water-based sealers are easier to apply and safer for the environment. If your granite countertop has a shiny polished surface, avoid using a sealer with a glossy finish. Applying sealer in most cases is quite simple, does not require any special tools, and can be completed in a few minutes. Wait at least 72 hours after the initial installation before applying sealer. Before sealing, it’s important to clean the granite countertop. A mild liquid detergent usually does the trick, but use denatured alcohol for the best results. After cleaning, completely dry the surface. Apply the sealer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Wait at least 2 hours before applying an additional coat. Generally, one coat is sufficient, but you may want to apply as many as three coats in a high traffic area. Test your granite countertops to see if they need an additional coat by applying a few drops of water to the surface. The water droplets should not be absorbed by the granite. If they get absorbed within a few minutes, it needs an additional coat of sealer. Food Safety Natural stone is not approved by the National Sanitation Foundation International for meeting food preparation standards because it is highly porous and absorbs moisture. General Care If your wood countertops are showing small scratches, lightly sand out flaws and re-oil the surface to restore it. For cutting surfaces, choose an unsealed, oil-finished product designed for food preparation. If you’re considering purchasing or already own a natural wood countertop for food preparation, here are some helpful maintenance tips: Before use, oil the cutting surface with food grade mineral oil or Emmet’s Elixir, an all-natural, anti-microbial wood conditioner. The board or block was oiled during construction but may have dried during storage and shipping. Be sure to coat the top, bottom, ends, and edges of the block every time you oil it. Apply oil often, especially when the block appears to be dry. DO NOT submerse the board in water. Instead, clean it with a wet cloth or sponge using a mild liquid detergent. You can use a disinfecting cleanser or a mixture of one teaspoon of chlorine bleach to one quart of water. Rinse well. Do not use powder cleanser. Allow the board to dry in a rack or with the board standing on edge to ensure sufficient air flow all the way around the board. To increase the life of the board, flip it over and use both sides. When determining how often to oil a block, the general rule of thumb is to oil it once a day for a week upon purchase; once a week for a month; and once a month forever. The block should be oiled whenever the wood starts to look dry and chalky. CARE & CLEANING SFI products require minimal care to maintain their original beauty. Avoid exposure to strong chemicals. If strong chemicals/cleaners containing methylene chloride acetone (nail polish remover), or acid drain cleaners come in contact with your vanity top or bowl, quickly flush the surface with plenty of soapy warm water. Even though all surfaces are non-porous, use of hair dye has been known to stain light colored tops. Cleaners with bleach may counteract the stain, but are not not recommended for general cleaning. Tops with Matte Finish Tops with a matte finish can be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge using general purpose cleaners. SFI’s products with a matte finish require minimal care to maintain their original beauty. These surfaces are non-porous so they can be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge using non-abrasive cleaners. The surface may need occasional polishing to maintain the gloss appearance. You can purchase polish products at your local home improvement store. Follow instructions carefully as build up of polish will cause tops to look dull. Tops with Gloss Finish Tops with a gloss finish can be cleaned with a damp cloth using non-abrasive cleaners.

MAINTENANCE & REPAIRTops with Matte FinishRemoving light stains and scratches: Use a green or silver Scotchbrite pad to remove stain or scratch. Dry and polish top using a solid surface cleaner/polish over the entire surface of the top. Repairing or incidental scratches and stains: Use water and 280 or 320 grit, wet/dry sandpaper to gently sand the affected area until smooth. Depending upon the depth of the scratch, it may be necessary to use a flat sanding block to prevent sanding to an uneven surface. These sanding blocks can be purchased at any home center store. Dry and polish top using a solid surface cleaner/polish over the entire surface of the top. Repairing of major damage: The surface is highly impact resistant; however, heavy or pointed objects striking the surface can leave damage. If repair of this damage cannot be accomplished using the above steps, contact your dealer for further information and options. Tops with Gloss FinishRepairing of incidental scratches and stains: Sand area with wet 600 grit (or comparable grit) sand paper. Deeper scratches may require sanding with 300 grit sand paper, then 600 grit and then continuing on to Step 2. Sand same area with wet 1200 grit (or comparable grit) sand paper. Wash surface. When surface is completely dry, apply a buffing compound, available at most auto parts stores. Using a high speed buffer, buff entire area with buffing compound. Buff and re-apply compound until area is back to original shine. Repairing of major damage: The surface is highly impact resistant; however, heavy or pointed objects striking the surface can leave damage.
