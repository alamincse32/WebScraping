Within the first week, I noticed my stress level dropped tremendously since I started using this product. I am very pleased with the result and will definitely continue buying more. – Becki I have suffered tendonitis for years and I’ve tried many different CBD. Kota Botanics RELIEVE tincture is by far the BEST CBD that I’ve ever used. I love that it’s organic so that I don’t have to worry about chemicals. Most importantly it has helped me getting out of my struggles when I use it every day. I’m so glad that I found Kota Botanics. THANK YOU!! – Michelle I take RELAX tincture to help me get a better sleep every night. For years, I’ve had troubles to sleep through the night. With just a few drops of RELAX oil, I was able to sleep through the entire night without any interruptions. Great stuff.

CBD (Cannabidiol) is a therapeutic compound (also called as “cannabinoid”) found in the flowers and leaves of the cannabis plants. Unlike THC (another well-known cannabinoid found in cannabis plants), CBD has no psychoactive properties, and won’t make you feel “high”. With over 114 types of Cannabinoids that can be derived from Cannabis plants, CBD is one of the most powerful, offering benefits that could potentially support your body, uplift your overall wellness, and much more. CBD can be found in hemp, as well as in marijuana. What’s the difference between Cannabis, Hemp and Marijuana? First of all, CBD is NOT marijuana. This is a common myth for a lot of people. CBD is a cannabinoid extracted from cannabis plant. Cannabis plant has many species which include both hemp and marijuana. When Farm Bill was passed and approved by Federal Government in 2018, it’s regulated THC in hemp has to stay less than 0.3%. Marijuana on the other hand will contain high levels of THC which could give you the “high”. What are the Cannabinoids? Cannabinoids are a group of active compounds that are produced by cannabis plants or the mammal bodies (yep, that includes us human, our puppies and kitties.). Cannabinoids in plants have a technical name called “phytocannabinoids“. “Phyto” means “by plant”. Cannabinoids produced by human or other mammal bodies are called “endocannabinoids“. “Endo” means “within”. What’s Endocannabinoid System (ECS)? The Endocannabinoid System is responsible for regulating the neurotransmitters and influencing the neuron communication within the body, specifically in response to the presence of cannabinoids. The system plays an essential role in the development of the central nervous system as well as synaptic plasticity (learning and memory). It is composed of receptors, endocannabinoids, and the enzymes needed for the creation and degradation of endocannabinoids. The main receptors used to mediate endocannabinoids are CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are found mainly in the central nervous system, specifically in the in the cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum. There, they are present in the axon terminals and pre-terminal axon segments, towards where they connect. It directs cognitive actions related to coordination, mood, thinking, memory, and appetite. CB2 receptors on the other hand are not nearly as present in the CNS as CB1 and are found in the vascular (blood carrying) and microglia (immune defense) segments of the body to regulate your immune system. What are Terpenes and What Roles Do They Play in CBD? Terpenes are the chemical compounds of the cannabis plant that are the cause of aromatics and taste. They play a vital role when it comes to the differentiation of effect in various strains. Some terpenes promote restful relaxation, while others may energize or uplift you. Terpenes can also be found in many other herbs, fruits, and plants. Here are some common terpenes found in cannabis plant as well as natural herbs, fruits, and plants. How Much CBD Should I take? Everyone is different when it comes to CBD dosing. Each individual’s endocannabinoid system is quite unique, so it may take a bit of experimentation to find the perfect balance. The rule of thumb is to start at a low dosage and stay slow. Working your way up if necessary — some people find a small dose works wonders, while others may need a much higher dose to achieve the desired effect. With consistent, daily use over time, your endocannabinoid system (ECS) becomes more sensitive and receptive, which results in greater beneficial effects. What are the differences between Full Spectrum, Broad Spectrum and Isolate? Full spectrum CBD also includes flavonoids; the natural fatty acids found in hemp, terpenes and other cannabinoids such as CBG, CBN and trace amounts of THC (0.3% or less). There are indications that these compounds work in concert to enhance therapeutic value or “Entourage Effect”. Broad Spectrum CBD contains a similar array of compounds as Full Spectrum, but with all THC removed. Manufacturers use a specific process to isolate and remove trace amounts of THC, while preserving the other, naturally occurring compounds. Broad Spectrum CBD is a good choice for individuals who don’t want any traces of THC in their system. Isolate is literally CBD that has been isolated from all other cannabinoids. For people who are interested in Isolate, be it due to sensitivities or other reasons, it’s important to pay attention to purity, as levels can differ between manufacturers. At Kota Botanics, we believe the power of all compounds from hemp. That’s why we present you with high quality Full Spectrum CBD products. We do not intend to provide medical information, and our products are not intended to cure or treat any disease. We recommend consulting your doctor if you have any questions regarding CBD. kotabotanicsstore 1,316 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes Open 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes ...

The products on this site are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Is hemp legal? The answer is YES. The 2018 Farm Bill created further clarification regarding hemp and hemp products. In addition to the 2018 bill, the legality of Cannabidiol from hemp is also supported by a 2004 unanimous ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which determined that the DEA “cannot regulate naturally-occurring THC not contained within or derived from marijuana, i.e., non-psychoactive hemp is not included in Schedule I. The DEA has no authority to regulate drugs that are not scheduled.” What is the difference between CBD derived from hemp versus marijuana? Our CBD products are all derived from hemp. They are at low THC level (<0.03%) . Marijuana has way more THC (>5%) than hemp. How do I choose a product that is right for me? When it comes to choosing the CBD product, there are many factors you’d need to consider such as potency, formulation, delivery method & your needs. It’s a complex process that’ll require a lot of research and study. We highly recommend you speak to reliable CBD retailers to do a phone or in-person consultation with them. A good CBD retail business should be able to make good recommendations for you based on your needs. What is the ideal dosing size? In general, dosage varies for each person depending on a wide range of variables including age, sex, weight, activity level, diet, desired outcome and the reason it’s being used. We highly recommend you find a reliable CBD retailer to do a further consultation. Are your products all lab tested? Yes, all of our products are all tested by third party labs. You can scan the QR code on the packaging to access the Certificate of Analysis (COA). Will I fail a drug test if I take CBD? Depends on the standards of the lab administering your drug test. Most companies only search for the THC cannabinoid. While our full spectrum CBD products contains less than 0.3% THC, there are some testing facilities that check for a spectrum of cannabinoids and could trigger a positive drug test. By law, you are allowed to ask the facility what cannabinoids they test for. If you are uncomfortable with that, you can call and ask anonymously. We suggest contacting the testing facility if there is any concern. What should I look for in terms of quality when choosing CBD? You should always look for high-quality CBD and look for the products that are extracted from organic, USA grown hemp. It should be pesticide free and come from a source that uses good manufacturing practices. Kota Botanics CBD oil is made with organically sun-grown USA hemp. We partner with a small artisanal family farm in upstate New York who practices organic growing method on their hemp cultivation. Our products are free of pesticide, herbicide, heavy metals and solvents. How long does it take for CBD to work? There are several important factors that come into play when determining the time to take effect when it comes to various methods of using CBD. Some of these variables are related to CBD itself, and others are related to how the human body reacts to CBD. Because of unique genetics, no two people react to CBD oil in the same way. Furthermore, factors such as age, weight, circulation and metabolism can all affect the timing of the effects of CBD oil. There are also numerous other factors involved such as the type of product being used, how it’s being used and how much is being used. The onset of edibles will typically take longer than that of tinctures, for example. kotabotanicsstore 1,316 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes Open 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes ...

You can call me “Vivian”. I’m the founder of Kota Botanics, a premium hemp CBD and plant-based health supplements company located in Fargo, North Dakota. I’m a proud first-generation immigrant from China to the United States. I was born and raised in south west China. I lived in Beijing for ten years after I graduated from college. Then I met my husband who’s a Fargo native studying mandarin in Beijing in 2004. We started dating and got engaged. I eventually moved to Fargo from Beijing in 2009 and have been living in this beautiful place since then. I became a lawful US citizen in May 2019 after I’ve lived in the US for almost 10 years, . I enjoy exercising, running (I ran a marathon in 2018, the biggest physical challenge in my life!), staying active and being close to nature. I also loved helping others to achieve their fitness and wellness goals. Things were going great until my youngest son Patrick was born in 2016. Patrick was born with an issue on one of his pulmonary valves. We had to spend 4 weeks at NICU of Masonic Children Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota for treatments. After we returned home from the NICU, I started experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks. I tried exercising, yoga and meditation, nothing seemed to help until I started experimenting with CBD in late 2018. Being raised in China, I am familiar with the benefits of plant-based medicine (Traditional Chinese Medicine) for illness treatments and wellness improvement. Still, CBD was quite a new thing to me. I was amazed on how much my mental and physical health have improved with a little help from CBD oil. I believe in its power and I know a lot more people could benefit from it as well. Late 2019, I decided to leave my stable corporate job and started Kota Botanics ™ , a premium CBD wellness retail shop in Fargo, ND. Within a year, we became the largest premium CBD wellness retailer in North Dakota. Our business was growing, but I never gave up the idea of starting our own premium CBD brand. After months and months of extensive searching, I finally found an artisanal family hemp farm in upstate New York that I could trust and eventually partnered with. Late 2020, we launched “Kota Botanics ™”, a premium artisanal hemp CBD wellness brand. Our phytocannabinoid-rich hemp is organically grown in the US, non-GMO, free of pesticides, herbicides, heavy medals, and solvents. We use supercritical CO2 extraction methods to ensure the highest concentration of a full profile of cannabinoids (CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC) extracted from the plant. We tasted each batch through a well-known certified third-party lab twice to guarantee potency, quality, and accuracy in dosing. We use the finest organic, plant-based, regenerative ingredients to formulate our products to ensure the quality, efficiency and safety. “Kota 康太” means “Happiness” and “Longevity” in Japanese. We are so excited for you to join us to improve your mental and physical wellness by experiencing with the finest premium products and services that you deserve. Let’s build a happy life, together in a “KOTA” way.

We hold a very high standard in this rapidly growing industry by working directly with our selected artisanal farmers to ensure quality, consistency, and craftsmanship of our products. We focus on bringing our customers true organic, clean, and safe products without adding any fillers and chemicals. We work with top industry chemists and herbalists to formulate our proprietary products with functioning herbs and botanicals to ensure the efficacy. Safety and Transparency are extremely important to us. That means multiple rounds of third-party lab testing are executed to ensure accurate concentrations of cannabinoids and the total absence of any contaminants like heavy metals, pesticides or residual solvents. Plants can do amazing things for our earth and for our health. We pride ourselves in providing a plant-based health solution to our customers who seek for the highest quality products with craftsmanship and integrity. Our Quality When it comes to hemp CBD oil, quality matters from seed to shelf. We partner with an amazing small family hemp farm who puts their heart and soul into every stage of the cultivation process. We have a great relationship with our farm and we know how hard they work to bring the top quality, organic sun-grown hemp to market. Our phytocannabinoid-rich (PCR) hemp is sun grown organically on a small farm in Berkshire, New York. Almost everything was done by hand, from cultivation to extraction. From seed to bottle, Kota Botanics CBD is grown, extracted, and bottled at the same facility by the same people that we work closely with. We believe in quality over quantity. That’s why we chose to partner with our farm instead of going with the larger commercial cultivation facilities. Triple lab-tested, Kota Botanics is free of mold, bacteria, pesticides, solvents, and heavy metals. Our Transparency We care about what our customers put in their bodies. To ensure the safety of our products, we have set a standard of rigorous three part third-party lab testing. All of our batch results are public to our customers. LAB REPORTS In tandem with our farm, two rounds of different batch tests are performed. Batch no. 1 tests the overall hemp extract/distillate. Our farm supplies a large amount of hemp extract/distillate to a third-party lab for a full panel test which includes cannabinoids potency, pesticides, heavy metals and residual solvents. This test guarantees that the farm’s extraction process produces the same quality of hemp extract/distillate every single time. It also verifies that the actual hemp extract/distillate itself is a clean, safe product. Batch no. 2 focuses specifically on cannabinoid, terpene and microbial analysis to guarantee safety and accurate dosing in all of our product formulas. Our Authenticity Kota Botanics is a real brand for real people. Every product we formulate is something that we’ve personally tested many times and wholeheartedly stand by. We are passionate for what we do and we are fueled by a genuine connection with our customers and our mission. When our founder Vivian started her CBD journey, she vowed to come up with a high quality product that’s also organic, authentic, efficient and genuine. She spent numerous months researching and finally found a partner farm to bring Kota Botanics CBD to life. Not just any farm though – Vivian wanted to work directly with a group of people who value and acknowledge the power of plants by sharing their passion for growing and caring for high quality hemp. Meet our founder Vivian Our Social Responsibility “There is no possible excuse for children to go hungry in this country. Yet it happens – every day, in every community.” According to USDA, there are more than 11 million children in the United States who live in “food insecure” homes. This number dates from before the coronavirus pandemic. Today, projections show that 18 million children could face hunger this year, meaning 1 in 4 kids could face hunger. No household should go without the necessities for every family member to live a healthy life.” As a small business owned by a woman of color, who is also a mother of two young children, Kota Botanics is committed to join the movement of ending child hunger in the US. For every product we sell, we donate a meal to the No Kid Hungry program. kotabotanicsstore 1,316 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes Open 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes ...

Joining is super easy! Just click the Create Account button to get started. Once you’re registered with our online store, you’ll have the opportunity to take part in all of the exciting ways we currently offer to earn points! How do I earn points? You can earn points by participating in any of our innovative promotions or activities such as below: Earn 100 points immediately once you sign up your account for free. Earn 1 point for every $1 spent on our online shop excluding shipping and tax. Earn 50 points for giving a review to the products you purchased. Earn 100 points for being born!! Receive 100 points from us when you enter your birthday. And receive a special gift from us on your birthday. Earn 50 points when you refer a friend to us and give your friends 10% off coupon for them to use. There’s no limit on how many friends you could refer. Points will be awarded to your account once they make a purchase. What can I redeem my points for? Glad you asked! We want to make it easy and fun to redeem your hard-earned points. Just click the ‘Claim’ tab to view all of our exciting reward options. How do I redeem my points? Exchanging your points for great rewards couldn’t be easier! Simply visit the ‘Claim’ tab to view all of our great reward options and click the ‘Claim Now’ button to redeem your reward. How do I check my points balance? Your up-to-date points balance is always displayed in the “My lifetime Points” under the dropdown menu within Earn Rewards program. Does it cost anything to begin earning points? Absolutely not! Sign up is 100% free, and it will never cost you anything to earn points. Make sure to visit the ‘Earn Points’ tab to get started. Do I have to enroll or register in individual promotions? Once you register for an account, you’re all set – we don’t require you to register for individual promotions in order to be eligible. Just fulfill the requirements of a promotion, and we’ll post the points to your account immediately! How long will it take for points to post to my account? You should receive points in your account instantly once you complete a promotion! Will my points expire? Nope! Your points will never expire. What happens to my points if I make a return? When you return an item, you lose the associated credit you originally earned by buying the item in the first place. Let’s take an example: let’s say you had previously spent $50 towards a $50 purchase, and you earned 50 points. Later you decide to return a $20 item, which resulted your purchase amount reduced to $30. Your points will be adjusted back to 30 points. How do I contact support if I have questions about my points? Our team is ready and waiting to answer your questions about our rewards program! Just send us an email to info@kotabotanics.com and we’ll be in touch. What if I don’t want to receive promotional emails? From time to time, you’ll receive program-related emails from us. If you’d prefer to not receive those types of emails anymore, just click the ‘Unsubscribe’ button when you receive your next email. kotabotanicsstore 1,316 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes Open 🤍✨☀️....#kotabotanics #selfcare #inspirationalquotes ...

Compliance With Applicable Laws The Website and the Services are based in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether the Content may be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States.

Termination Of The Agreement We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate this Agreement and your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability.

Arbitration Agreement In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Services or any other products or services provided by us (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website http://www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent Kota Botanics, from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect Kota Botanics, proprietary interests. 17. Class Action Waiver You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS CUSTOMER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 18. Miscellaneous This Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of North Dakota, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the Termination provision above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: “Subscription Process, Renewal and Cancellation,” “Billing and Payments,” “Disclaimers,” “Communications with Us,” “No Warranties; Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Termination of the Agreement,” “Arbitration Agreement,” “Class Action Waiver,” and “Miscellaneous.” Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees. 19.
