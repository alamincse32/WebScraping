Our Story02. In The News03. ContactSign UpFounded in Fargo.Where we startedFounded from a university engineering product aiming to design a 3D printed myoelectric arm, Protosthetics quickly realized that O&P was more excited about getting the benefits of 3D printing for existing products than looking for something new.With that in mind, we launched our central fabrication business in 2016, and have been continuously combining the best customer experience, clinical knowledge, and cutting edge fabrication techniques. Protosthetics brings products to O&P clinicians that allow them to best fulfill their primary purpose - providing excellent patient care to those that deserve it most. A leader in additive manufacturing.how we got here3DÂ printing started as a means to more reliably and cost effectively create products that already exist in O&P. After innovating in manufacturing the current standard of care products using this transformative technology, we've worked to design new ones across the O&P landscape. âAfter years of customer requests for the benefits of 3D printing in-clinic - improved turnaround time, savings, and repeatability - we launched the Galileo program in late 2021. It's the first of its kind, a fully managed 3D printing program designed exclusively for O&P, built from the ground up with the practitioner in mind. Cutting edge tech, backed by people who care.where we're goingAt Protosthetics, our North Star is a stellar customer experience. Everything we do is laser focused on improving the customer experience with simple ordering, comprehensive and friendly customer support, excellent product design, and everything in between. âTechnology is a huge part of our continous improvement.

Included in that mission is a promise to utilize the latest cutting-edge technology to ensure the best possible outcomes.âAs the director of prosthetics at Sandhills, Troy Decker, BOCP, takes this goal to heart. âOur patients look to our referral sources to see that weâre a cutting-edge facility and staying on top of whatâs newest and best,â said Decker, and he intends to prove the Sandhills facility fits that criteria.âIn the past, doing all the fabrication by hand took valuable time away from patients and evenings away from his family to keep up with the workload. Providing 3D printed prosthetics had always been on Deckerâs radar as a solution, but he didn't dive for it until Galileo came along.âDecker with the Protosthetics Galileo Printer and 3D Printed SocketsâIn November, 2022, Decker implemented 3D printing at Sandhills by introducing the Galileo program, and his team completely embraced the new process with proof of efficiency. Decker sees Galileo as another technical team on his side. âTheyâre just a text away, a phone call away, and are always so receptive.âÂ âWith the 3D printer on-site, Decker and his team can rapidly turn ideas into reality and gain control over their work.

He assisted in researching and integrating the Galileo program, and he quickly took charge maintaining the machine and starting prints, which has taken significantly less time than previous work fully fabricating the check sockets.âVanamanâs creativity has also transformed their printer into an advertising tool. He strategically placed the 3D printer in the facility's lobby, captivating visitors and proving the practice's commitment to innovation. âYouâd be amazed how much interest that generates, and it shows patients that weâre doing our best to stay up with the latest, greatest technology,â said Decker.âAdditionally, Vanaman had the brilliant idea to transform a 3D printed check socket into a lamp, wiring RGB colors into the socket to light it up and showcase it to teammates and patients alike. âItâs almost been a better marketing tool, without even planning on it,â Decker exclaimed in awe. âEverybody thinks itâs awesome!ââCheck Socket Lamp Changing ColorsâItâs almost been a better marketing tool, without even planning on it.ââTo those considering the leap into Galileo 3D printing, Deckerâs message is clear: embrace it wholeheartedly. The benefits, from improved communication and turnaround time to enhanced patient care and a touch of innovation, are undeniable. âItâs a wonderful team of technicians that are ready to serve and answer questions.ââHaving printed over 120 Galileo orders in 10 months, the Sandhills team remains headstrong in energizing their work with the program. Not only has it transformed Deckerâs process, but it has helped maintain their reputation as a cutting-edge facility. âGetting Galileo is definitely a step in the right direction,â said Decker. âI would not look back!ââAbout Sandhills Orthotics and ProstheticsSandhills Orthotics and Prosthetics is a clinic in Pinehurst, North Carolina focused on providing orthotic, prosthetic, and mastectomy services.

7,"New Life with Limbs: Empowering Lives through Prosthetics and 3D Printing | Protosthetics ProtostheticsGalileo Central Fabrication Blog About ï¡¹+1 701-478-2001Annie Hockert8/9/2023Share on: Facebook Twitter LinkedInNew Life with Limbs: Empowering Lives through Prosthetics and 3D PrintingIn 2013, James Goff, CP, embarked on a life-changing journey to establish New Life with Limbs, a nonprofit organization with a noble mission: to provide prosthetic limbs to people in developing world countries with limited access to prosthetics. Goff has been on over 10 trips in 10 years, bringing prosthetics to Haiti, Sierra Leone, and most recently the Dominican Republic.âSierra Leone, in particular, holds a significant place in his heart due to its history of civil war, during which many individuals were left amputated. The organization's work in these countries has been transformative, giving amputees a new lease on life. Goff mentioned that âto do this job, you have to love people. And watching them get back to life and be a whole person is the best part.â â""Watching them get back to life and be a whole person is the best part.â âGoff and the New Life with Limbs crew had the opportunity to visit the Dominican Republic twice in 2022 and again in July of 2023. They have another trip planned for February, 2024. âWe put in the hard work here and now so we can have fun and make a difference over there,â he said of creating the sockets for a good cause.âJames Goff (back) and New Life with Limbs crew member (left) stand with prosthetic recipient in the Dominican Republic, 2023âOver the years, New Life with Limbs has gained support through various fundraising events. Notably, the organization holds an annual sponsorship golf tournament, which recently celebrated its 5th year. This year, the event was a tremendous success, with 18 teams of 4 participating and filling the golf course!âOver $14,000 was raised during the outing, enabling them to make a more significant impact. The time and effort dedicated to creating the products is volunteer-based, so 100% of funds goes to supplying the prosthetics to those in need. Thus, when Goff decided to embrace the potential of 3D printing technology, it made this yearâs goal more attainable.Â âIn March of 2023, Goff added the Protosthetics Galileo program as his additive manufacturing partner in 3D printing. Since then, heâs become comfortable with the printing process for his business Prosthetic Solutions of Indiana. â3D printing has deleted extra steps and made everything more seamless,â said Goff. So when he began considering fabrication options for New Life with Limbs, he turned to Galileo.Â ââ3D printing has deleted extra steps and made everything more seamless.""âProtosthetics readily agreed to print copoly diagnostic sockets for the charity and charge only for the cost of material and shipping. New Life with Limbs supplied around 50 prosthetics during this yearâs trip to the Dominican Republic, 39 of which were printed with Galileo and their partners at Filament Innovations. âNot only did Gaileo save time and money, but it made this yearâs trip possible,â said Goff.âCopoly sockets lined up for distribution, Dominican Republic 2023âThe use of 3D printing increased fabrication efficiency, allowing the nonprofit to allocate more resources to its core mission. Goff particularly liked being able to start a print and then focus on other work before starting the next. âWhen working on a time crunch, itâs important to have peace of mind that everything will get done,â he said of 3D printing time-savings.âJames Goff and New Life with Limbs have been providing hope, mobility, and empowerment to hundreds of amputees around the world. Not only are they helping people physically, but they also see their mission as a vehicle to spread the gospel of Jesus. âGod has blessed us with this awesome opportunity,â he rejoiced. âWe will share the love of Christ with the world.âÂ ââGod has blessed us with this awesome opportunity.ââAs they continue their mission, New Life with Limbs will be a beacon of light for those in need, proving that technology, compassion, and a determined spirit can create positive change in the world.âAbout ProtostheticsProtosthetics was the first central fab facility in the United States to be based solely on 3D printing and CAD/CAM manufacturing. Using this technology means lower costs, shorter lead times, and repeatable, predictable quality each and every time.

8,"Miller P&O Embraces Cutting-Edge Innovations With Galileo | Protosthetics ProtostheticsGalileo Central Fabrication Blog About ï¡¹+1 701-478-2001Annie Hockert6/9/2023Share on: Facebook Twitter LinkedInMiller P&O Embraces Cutting-Edge Innovations With GalileoâIn his more-than 30 years of practice, Mark Miller, CPO and owner of Miller Prosthetics & Orthotics in Belpre, Ohio, has had to embrace change and overcome challenges to achieve success in his field. âIâve always tried to stay on the leading edge of where things are going with prosthetics,â said Miller of experimenting with new technologies.Â ââIâve always tried to stay on the leading edge of where things are going with prosthetics.â âMany new ideas and softwares have emerged over the years, and Miller has always found excitement in exploring them. When he first started his company 10 years ago, Mark - along with his wife and partner Nancy - went to the New York Maker Faire, a convention of creators and inventions. 3D printing was just really starting to take off then, and Miller remembers already wanting to try printing prosthetics.âCo-Owners Mark (CPO) and Nancy (CEO) of Miller Prosthetics & OrthoticsâHowever, he was shocked by how many innovators at the Faire knocked down the idea, hailing it as impossible to print organic shapes. Still, printers emerged for that very purpose, and he eagerly tried to utilize several different brands. âI was on my 2nd or 3rd desktop 3D printer, but I was never able to really do anything with them,â Miller stated. âGetting the scan to print the right shape has always been the issue.âÂ âBut when Nancy suggested the newly-rising Galileo program, Miller didnât hesitate to give it a try. Soon, he found the experience ârefreshingly surprisingâ when it exceeded the teamâs expectations. âAt first I wasnât sure how accurate everything was going to be, but the shapes, the process - everything seems to be really spot-on.â The ability to receive text notifications when prints are ready on their in-clinic printer, combined with the programâs efficient turnaround time, has revolutionized Millerâs day-to-day processes.Â ââAt first I wasnât sure how accurate everything was going to be, but the shapes, the process - everything seems to be really spot-on.âââThereâs no downtime with it,â mentioned Miller. Right now, he takes a scan, modifies it, sends in an order, and itâs ready to print in a matter of hours. He also recalled a time when he briefly stopped in the print-room to see a print had been completed. Miller started the next print and left, checking on it via a live webcam. He was in and out in minutes and had the confidence to leave it on its own so he could prioritize patients.Â âMark Miller Shows off Galileo 3D Printed Check Socket & Inner LinerâAnother notable benefit of using Galileo, according to Miller, is the Galileo teamâs dedication to constantly improving. âIâve been doing CAD for 30 years, and you get a lot of people who donât do what they say theyâre going to do with regards to product improvements. Galileo is the opposite.â In fact, Miller was able to work with the Galileo team to get his own flexible inner print design that was optimized for their team to use in lamination.Â ââIâve been doing CAD for 30 years, and you get a lot of people who donât do what they say theyâre going to do with regards to product improvements. Galileo is the opposite.ââWith a passion for innovation deeply rooted in their practice, the Miller P&O team remains committed to embracing the future. In reference to whether he would recommend Galileo, âGet it,â Miller said. â...Except my competitors - they can stay behind,â he laughed.
