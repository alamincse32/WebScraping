This can lead to mold, mildew, warping, or structural damage. CondensationCondensation is perfectly normal. It simply indicates the presence of humidity, which means your windows or doors are doing their job and holding heat inside your home. Faulty OperationDifficulty opening or closing, sticking sash, and pesky operational issues can sometimes be solved with a thorough cleaning or small repair. However, these can also be signs that parts are nearing the end of their lifespan. Climate ControlNew windows and doors can get rid of drafts to make rooms more comfortable. But if the time isn’t right replacement can wait. Cosmetic IssuesIssues like chipped paint, tarnished hardware, and dirty weather stripping can be addressed on your schedule with routine care and maintenance. Selections To Discuss With Your Expert Our Replacement experts will guide you through making the best choices for your replacement project. Window and Door Styles Start with what you already have. Do you like how it works in the space now, or are you ready to try a different look or operation? Materials The most important part of choosing any window or door is understanding which type of material will work best for your home. Marvin window and door frames are available in fiberglass, aluminum, and wood. Divided Lites Sometimes called grids or grilles, divided lites let you stylize any window or door. Choose from our existing patterns or create something entirely new. Colors Take your pick from a spectrum of interior and exterior colors and wood stain options, all curated to help you find the perfect hue. Consider Additional Options Available Exclusively On Marvin Windows and Doors. Glass Glass goes beyond energy efficiency. Decorative and privacy glass, and even glass that provides additional sound reduction, can be paired with thermal performance options for a window or door that is perfect for your home. Home Automation Send signals to home security systems to indicate if a window or door is closed and locked. The best part? No unsightly add-on sensors! Screens Screens shouldn’t be an afterthought. Look for products with screen options that don’t distract from the beauty of your new windows, like stainable wood interior screen surrounds with Marvin Bright View screen mesh. Hardware Marvin Gallery Hardware is a beautiful selection of unique door hardware. It's like jewelry for doors, and we have something for every design style. Consider Warranty Coverage When choosing a manufacturer for your project, consider their warranty coverage. Note whether the warranty is transferable or not, the components it covers, and for what length of time. We are proud to offer a fully transferable comprehensive warranty. A summary of our warranty is provided here to assist as you evaluate replacement window and door options for your home. Our warranty applies to Marvin products.

Reimagine your home with Marvin Skycove and Awaken Skylight windows, connecting you to more natural light, air, and views. Find a Dealer to learn more.Find A Dealer Happier, Healthier Living Overview Awaken Skycove Modern Take Virtual Tour Find A Dealer Living well with light, air, and views People spend more time indoors now than ever before. We believe our indoor spaces should help us connect to each other and to the world around us. We believe in spaces where we can recharge and escape, places that make us feel healthy, safe, and secure. That’s why we interviewed thousands of homeowners and industry professionals. We learned from sleep scientists, technologists, light specialists, hygge experts, and even astronauts. We conducted extensive research in Copenhagen, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Alaska. These conversations and research have led us to develop new-to-the-world products designed to support happier, healthier living. Light Healthy biological rhythms need the right kind of light at the right time to boost your mood, enhance sleep, and support productivity. There’s a real connection between light and our health. Sleep scientists understand that natural light promotes daily rhythm, which can help regulate hormonal balance, appetite, sleep, productivity, and energy levels, thereby impacting not only physical health but also emotional and social well-being. Air We are committed to finding new ways to bring fresh air more thoughtfully into your favorite spaces. High levels of indoor pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone, radon, and carbon monoxide can be reduced simply by increasing the amount of outdoor air circulating through your home. Views Views of the outside world give us a sense of place and calm. And connecting the indoors to the outside world builds a sense of optimism, boosts our mood, and provides energy that helps us live better. Marvin products are inspired by how people live and bring a feeling of quality and wellness into every room. ""Natural light is a must, it's critical to my well-being.” Homeowner Discover Awaken Awaken’s supplemental, tunable lighting mimics the ideal color temperature of natural light to provide the right light at the right time, and the four-sided venting system can quickly circulate fresh air into your home. Awaken is equipped with smart sensors that automatically shut the unit if rain is detected, and the indoor air quality sensors will send you an alert when changes in VOCs are detected.Learn More “Beautiful views through large expanses of glass make me feel relaxed and in-tune with nature.” Homeowner Discover Skycove® Imagine an inviting space, flooded in light, where you can enjoy a cup of coffee with a close friend or escape into a good book. Marvin Skycove is a glass structure that projects into the open air creating a smart extension of up to 20 square feet of usable space that delivers stunning, panoramic views. Marvin created Skycove with a forward-thinking, people-first design inspired to help people live better in their homes.

As people spend more time indoors, we recognize that our work isn’t just about building better windows and doors—it’s about opening new possibilities for how people live, work, think and feel inside a Marvin space. Since the day we opened our doors in 1912 as a family-owned and -operated cedar and lumber company, we’ve looked for ways to help people live better. We continue to evolve by raising the bar, building quality, beauty and simplicity into people’s everyday lives. We are Marvin, and this is our story — thank you for being part of it. Design for People We design for how people live and work, imagining new ways to help them feel healthier and happier in the spaces where they live, work and play. A natural connection Warm sunlight, fresh air and a connection to the natural world can instantly change the mood of a home or office. We design our products to make that connection feel seamless—even in the most challenging of spaces. Thoughtful details We are committed to design that is as functional and intuitive as it is beautiful. Crafted with exceptional skill, our products deliver quality you can see, touch, and feel, beauty that brings joy, and performance that stands the test of time. Innovate with Intention We see infinite potential in how spaces can serve people better. Pushing boundaries Rather than meeting expectations, we push ourselves to elevate the standard for excellence. Whether we’re replicating historic millwork, engineering uninterrupted views or improving energy performance, we look for what we can do better — and then we design it. An open future We are driven by a spirit of possibility. As needs change and people seek ways to improve their spaces, we must also evolve to meet these needs in new and unexpected ways. For every innovation, we continue to measure our success against how well we help people live happier and healthier lives.

Awning windows have a single sash hinged at the top of the frame. Their sash swings outward from the bottom using either a folding hand crack or manual handle. Awning windows are often installed higher up on a wall for privacy or space concerns. They may be placed above doors or larger windows to provide discrete natural lighting and ventilation, as well as an expanded view. Awning windows are also energy efficient, as breezes and high winds blowing against them serve to tighten their seal. When open, awning windows are perfect for inviting in a cool breeze and ushering out stagnant hot air. Their top-hinge design allows water to shed out and away from the opening.

Picture windows provide expansive views of the outdoors and are non-operable, meaning they cannot be opened. They are often strategically placed in living rooms, dining rooms, and other areas where a large window is desired for its aesthetic appeal and to increase the amount of natural daylight. When to use picture windows? Picture windows are best used in conjunction with other operable windows and doors to create a larger window system. They are designed to match profiles and sight lines of operable windows creating a cohesive look and a larger expanse of glass to maximize views and natural light. What are Direct Glaze (Fixed) Windows? Direct glaze windows, also known as fixed windows, are a popular choice for modern homes. The glass is set directly into the frame without a sash and held in place with an adhesive creating a simple, clean profile with more glass area for an expanded view. Direct glaze windows are non-operable and they are often used in areas where an unobstructed view is desired. When to use Fixed (Direct Glaze) Windows? Direct glaze windows are a good option for a standalone window or direct glaze only assembly. The profile is unique and thoughtful consideration needs to be taken when mixing with other product types from the collection. Direct glaze windows come in a variety of shapes, which can be utilized to make assemblies that follow a roof’s pitch or to create unique statement pieces.

Bay windows are most often one large center window with two narrow windows installed on either side. The narrow windows angle to project beyond the exterior wall of the house, creating a three-dimensional view. Bow windows also project beyond the outside of the building but are usually composed of four or more near-identical windows. As a result, bow windows have a curved effect rather than an angular one, and may need more space than a bay window. Both bay and bow windows can be installed in individual rough openings in the wall, or the factory can mull (connect) them together and then ship and install them as one large unit. Bay and bow windows are popular for their ability to open a room, maximize natural light, and provide a unique view. They also make for cozy reading nooks with discrete storage built under the seat.

The key difference between these styles is that both the top and bottom sashes of a double hung window are movable. Only the bottom sash operates on single hung windows. Single hung windows are ideal for areas where the top sash might be difficult to reach.

Thanks to their single sash design, these windows can offer a wide uninterrupted view, top-notch ventilation, and painless cleaning.

Bi-fold doors, also called folding or accordion doors, consist of multiple panels hinged to each other that fold open and close like an accordion. Interior bi-fold doors are often used for closets or pantries and usually have two panels. Exterior bi-fold doors can feature many floor-to-ceiling glass panels and open to present an entry and exit space up to 55 feet long. Bi-fold doors are ideal for spaces with stunning views and sweeping vistas and can strengthen a room’s connection to the natural world. Their panels stack up against the edge of an opening, meaning they take up less frame area compared to large-paneled sliding doors. This space-saving design means bi-fold exterior doors are great for high-traffic areas like patios or decks. Some bi-fold doors come fitted with a traffic door on one panel that allows easy passage in and out without having to open the larger panel.

Wood options shown are to demonstrate the approximate look of each species only, and stain samples are shown on Pine. Photos are not intended to reflect a product's interior or exterior profile. Stained WoodWhen compared to painting or staining on the job site, factory-stained finishes offer consistent quality and performance resulting from our expertise with wood as a material and years of perfecting our staining process. Every piece of wood receives even coats of conditioning and stain, two coats of clear finish, and is sanded and baked twice in an oven before your window or door is built to create a consistent, durable and high-quality finish that brings out the natural beauty, texture, and grain of the wood. Our stained wood products meet industry standards and arrive ready to install.Selected: Painted WoodPainting on the job site or scheduling off-site finishing is an extra step that takes time and coordination. Choose our primed white or white painted interior finish option on any Marvin pine windows and doors with a wood exterior, or an additional designer black paint option for products with an aluminum clad exterior. Your windows and doors will arrive factory-painted and ready to install. You can count on consistency with our process, as every piece of wood receives a coat of prime and is sanded before being painted. The paint is baked twice in an oven before your window or door is built to create a consistent, durable and high-quality painted finish that performs to the industry standard. All interior surfaces are standard bare wood. Opt for prime for ease of applying a top coat in the field. For Clad doors, choose White or Designer Black interior finishes. Wood exterior Ultimate Doors offer Painted White interior finish except on the Multi-slide Doors.Selected: *Finish samples are approximate and colors on screen can vary.

The Ogee profile is more traditional , or square can be specified for a clean, crisp, more contemporary look.Selected: Hardware Our industry-exclusive flush-mount hardware is concealed for a clean aesthetic and built with intuitive design for easy operation. When the Flush-mount hardware is in the up position, the panel is closed, dropped and locked. When in the down position, the panel is open, lifted and stacked or pocketed. Finishes in Bronze, Brass and Satin Nickel are available with a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) finish, meaning the hardware has undergone a process that adds a layer of toughness to resist fading and discoloration by direct sunlight, humidity, and most other environmental factors, even in coastal areas. Selected: *Hardware finish samples are approximate. Please visit your local Marvin dealer to see hardware finish samples.

Sliding doors consist of one or more door panels that either glide open on a bottom-mounted track or on hanging rollers mounted from above. The different styles of sliding doors include multi-slide doors, French doors, barn doors, pocket doors, lift-and-slide doors, and patio doors (sometimes called a sliding glass door). Unlike swinging doors that need extra space for the panel to open, the sliding door’s panels stack. This makes them ideal for living rooms or balconies that may have furniture in the way. Exterior sliding doors are typically two or more large glass panels, earning them the nickname “panoramic doors.” Sliding doors make for massive openings that can open up a room and create a stronger sense of connection to the surrounding nature. This design is also ideal for high-traffic areas like the passageway leading to the backyard or patio during a get-together.

The energy efficient, LED lighting can be adjusted to the ideal color temperature of natural light—supporting circadian rhythm, easing transitions from day to night, and helping people feel better at home no matter where they live, what time of year it is, or which direction their house faces. Breathe new energy into your space with smart-sensor skylight venting It’s easy to refresh any space with Awaken’s first-of-its-kind venting system. Awaken opens on all four sides, filling your home with fresh air faster than traditional hinged units. It’s equipped with smart sensors that automatically shut the unit if rain is detected, and the indoor air quality sensors will send you an alert when changes in VOCs are detected. So, take a deep breath and enjoy the energizing feeling that a home filled with fresh air can provide. Bring the outdoors in Views of the outside world give us a calming sense of place, which is why Awaken’s features have been thoughtfully integrated into the frame. Its durable fiberglass structure has been designed with narrow sight lines, creating more space for sky views. Awaken’s patent-pending screen only surrounds the perimeter of the unit instead of obscuring the glass, leaving nothing between you and the view. Design Flexibility Fulfill your design vision with a wide range of sizes, including the biggest operational units on the market. And thanks to Awaken’s low, sleek profile, even the largest sizes will not dominate a roofline. The thoughtful lighting and shading options allow you to create an atmosphere to fit the needs of any room. Plus Awaken colors match other Marvin windows and doors for a seamless pairing across all product lines.

Design Options Exterior Finish Exterior Fiberglass FinishBuilt for durability and low maintenance, our Ultrex® coatings are three times thicker than competitive finishes. These protective coatings have a smooth consistency, and even the darkest colors resist fading, chalking, peeling, and cracking. The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) awards certifications to materials that pass numerous, rigorous tests. These tests simulate the harsh conditions that a finish will encounter throughout the life of the window or door. Passing these specification tests and achieving AAMA 624 verification gives independent confirmation that the Ultrex finish is best in class among fiberglass products.Selected: Interior Finish Interior Fiberglass FinishThe Ultrex® pultruded fiberglass interior features a durable, low-maintenance finish in Stone White.Selected: Mounting Options Each Awaken unit is shipped with the hardware necessary for installation on a curb or directly to the decking. The appropriate flashing kit for your installation choice is selected at the time of ordering. Glass Awaken skylights are equipped with dual layers of glazing. For your protection, the exterior glass (outboard) is tempered, which increases its strength and ability to withstand impacts. The indoor layer (inboard) is laminated, which means the glass will hold together in the event of severe impact. Awaken’s glass is also treated in Low E3 coatings. These microscopically thin, essentially invisible coatings on the glass surface help manage the amount of heat radiation that passes through a window pane or reflected away from it, reducing a home’s dependence on heat and air conditioning. Screens Clear views of the outside world give us a sense of place and calm, which is why we designed Awaken’s patent-pending screen into the frame. As the unit projects outward, the screen shields the side openings from insects and debris. No part of Awaken’s glass is ever covered by a screen. The result is an expansive and unobscured view of the sky. Shades Both the room-darkening and light-filtering optional shades are fully integrated and exclusively designed for Awaken skylights. They are built with durable, UV-resistant fabric and are protected by a 5-year warranty. Easily control your shading with a user-friendly app, wall switches, or smart home systems like Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings. Fixed Skylight If venting is not part of your design vision, consider a non-venting, or fixed Awaken. Tunable lighting, VOC sensors, integrated shades, and smart home features are all available on a fixed unit, and the exterior profiles are the same as a venting Awaken. This allows you to combine both types and maintain visual continuity on the roof lines. Designed with people at the center For forward-thinking architects, interior designers, homeowners, and builders, Marvin Awaken and Marvin Skycove® create a space for air, light, view, and comfort.

Energy Efficiency Overview Energy Star Glass & Glazing Performance CTA Here Energy Efficiency Basics I need new windows. What’s the first thing I need to know when it comes to windows and energy efficiency? Replacing windows with energy-efficient ones can help reduce your utility bills, but the benefits go much further. Choosing energy-efficient windows makes your home more comfortable, as their performance determines how much heat comes in and escapes out through the windows. How do I know if a window or a door is energy efficient? Certification programs such as those administered by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) and ENERGY STAR provide ratings designed to indicate a window or door’s efficiency. Various performance ratings – like U-factor and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient – measure a product’s effectiveness in insulating and blocking heat from the sun, among other things. See the Glossary of Terms. Are tax credits still available for energy-saving window and door replacement? Tax credit programs change often. To stay up-to-date with the latest, visit www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits. Here is a link to the Marvin Manufacturers' Certification Statement. U-Factor Simply put, U-factor measures how well a window keeps heat inside your home. It’s a measure of total heat flow through a window or door from room air to outside air. Lower numbers indicate greater insulating capabilities. It’s a particularly important measure for climates with colder winters. Solar-Heat Gain If U-factor denotes how much heat leaves your home, the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) measures how much radiant heat enters your home. All you really need to remember is: The lower the number, the less heat a window lets in. Visible Transmittance The amount of visible light transferred through a window. Low E coatings can reject solar heat gain without significant reduction to visible light passing through the glass. Energy Star© Hear builder Matt Risinger explain how the ENERGY STAR program can help you maximize comfort and energy efficiency by selecting windows and doors suited to your climate zone. ENERGY STAR’s U-Factor is a number indicating how well the product insulates, to maintain interior temperatures. What does it mean to be an ENERGY STAR-certified window or door? To obtain ENERGY STAR certification, a window or door must meet a set of requirements that are determined by the U.S. government. Those requirements differ based on geography, meaning a window that’s being installed in Minnesota has different requirements than one in Florida. The certification is meant to indicate that the window is energy-efficient in the region where it will be used, and can help homeowners save on energy costs. Energy Star Criteria Zone Window U-Factor Window SHGC Door U-Factor Door SHGC Skylight U-Factor Skylight SHGC Northern ≤ 0.22* = 0.23 = 0.24 = 0.25 = 0.26 ≥ 0.17* ≥ 0.35 ≥ 0.35 ≥ 0.40 ≥ 0.40 ≤ 0.26 ≤ 0.40 ≤ 0.45 Any North Central ≤ 0.25 ≤ 0.40 ≤ 0.26 ≤ 0.40 ≤ 0.50 ≤ 0.25 South Central ≤ 0.28 ≤ 0.23 ≤ 0.28 ≤ 0.23 ≤ 0.50 ≤ 0.25 Southern ≤ 0.32 ≤ 0.23 ≤ 0.28 ≤ 0.23 ≤ 0.50 ≤ 0.25 *Prescriptive Value Does my window need to be ENERGY STAR certified in order to be energy efficient? No. While an ENERGY STAR label can be helpful in identifying energy-efficient windows, every home is unique. ENERGY STAR provides a one-size-fits-all guideline but does not take into consideration, for example, the orientation of the house or the number or size of windows and associated Solar Heat Gain. A window expert like your Marvin dealer can help determine which products will work best for you. ENERGY STAR also recognizes products that meet high energy-efficiency guidelines. Marvin offers the industry’s widest selection of wood and clad wood products that meet these rigorous criteria. Glazing Description Climate Energy Performance Low E1 Features a single layer of metallic coating, which blocks heat loss to the outside while reflecting heat back into the room. Northern Low U-Factor High solar heat gain Low E2 Features a double layer of silver on an inside surface of IG glass. It provides year round performance and comfort. This coating option provides better protection against radiant heat transfer than single layer metallic Low E coatings. Northern North-Central South-Central Low U-Factor medium solar heat gain Low E3 Features three layers of metallic silver and provides the lowest solar heat gain performance in climates where sun exposure is intense and cooling costs are high. Northern North-Central South-Central Southern Lower U-Factor lower solar heat gain Low ERS A high performance insulating glass that features a Low-E coating on the room-side glass (4th surface) and low E3 on the 2nd glass surface. Northern North-Central South-Central Southern Superior U-Factor lower solar heat gain Glass & Glazing Can you help me to better understand the numbers? What’s a good U-factor number? What’s a good SHGC? Different homeowners seek out different levels of efficiency, but a “good” U-factor is <.30. A “good” Solar Heat Gain rating, meanwhile, on a scale from 0 to 1, is relative to climates in different regions. Low SHGC numbers are best for southern climates where there’s intense sun exposure, whereas higher SHGC values make the most sense for regions with cold winters. Can you explain Low E coatings? The ability of a material to radiate energy (heat) is called its emissivity. Extremely thin coatings of special low emissivity (Low E) metallic material are applied to glass panes used in windows and doors to boost their energy efficiency. Low E coatings, usually applied to the inside layers of insulating glass, manage the amount of light and heat either conducted through a window or reflected away from it. Are triple pane windows the best? The more panes the better, right? Not always. Triple-pane windows work best when enhanced energy performance is a key objective. Tripane offers a range of low-E configurations for greater Solar Heat Gain control, including panes filled with argon or krypton-argon gas for added efficiency. But no matter how many panes there are, if the window is poorly constructed, poorly installed or allows air leakage, it will not be efficient. Insulating Glass (IG) Two or more glass panes separated by energy efficient inert gas or air to reduce thermal transfer. Low E Low E stands for low emissivity. Microscopically thin, transparent metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a glass surface suppress radiative heat flow and reflect interior infrared energy (heat) back to the inside, reducing heat loss through the glass. Various Low E coating options can manipulate heat gain to match different climate needs. Gas Fills Argon or krypton mixes slow the movement of warm and cool air in IG airspaces and improve thermal performance. Tripane Glazing Energy efficiency is achieved through the use of various window technologies. Low E coatings, frame materials, glazing types, spacers, gas fill, and weatherstripping all contribute to efficient windows.

It’s easier than ever before. Modern sustainable building methods, like Passive building, LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and Net Zero building can help you minimize environmental impact and maximize energy efficiency. ENERGY STAR also offers a “Most Efficient” list, a distinction that recognizes products that deliver superior efficiency through cutting-edge technologies and innovations. Marvin is an industry leader in offering a wide selection of products that meet these rigorous criteria. Is sustainable building the same as high performance building? Sustainable building refers to both a structure and to processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building’s life-cycle: from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. According to the National Institute of Building Sciences, high performance building integrates and optimizes all major high-performing building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity. Learn more about Most Efficient products at the EPA ENERGY STAR website. 11,279 Certified Window & Door Product/Glass options meet a .20 U-Factor and lower Can I make my home a high performance building? There are methods to optimize energy efficiency in a home environment, most easily with new construction. One way is to plan for a building to generate at least as much energy as it consumes. Net Zero homes and Zero Net Ready homes are carefully designed structures that currently or in the future make use of alternative energy solutions such as wind, solar and/or geothermal systems. You don’t need to build a Net Zero home to dramatically improve energy performance in your home. Whether replacing windows in an existing home or designing a new construction, there are plenty of energy-saving windows to choose from.

Use this checklist as an annual maintenance reminder. Make sure the weatherstrip is still effective. If not, call your local Marvin dealer. Examine the window's interior and exterior finishes. Occasional repair to a damaged finish may be necessary. Don’t let paints, stains and varnishes come in contact with the weatherstrip. Solvents can damage the weatherstrip’s performance. Trim any old, loose caulking and seal any gaps with an appropriate, high quality caulk. Occasionally, an excess of silicone sealant, called “squeeze-out,” appears around the edge of the glass. You can safely scrape off “squeeze-out” with a plastic putty knife without damaging the weather-tightness of your window or door. Make sure all exposed hardware screws are tightened securely. Apply a dry lubricant to the windows’ gears to keep them operating smoothly. Clean sand, dirt or dust from door and window hinges, sills and tracks. Check energy panels and storm and screen combinations to make sure screws and turn buttons are securely fastened. Check doors for smooth operation. Note: Wood doors require a stabilization period after installation, sometimes taking up to a year to adjust to humidity levels and other environmental factors. Location plays an important role in how often you should clean and maintain the exterior of aluminum clad windows and doors. A coastal home exposed to harsh elements may need cleaning four or five times a year, while in a drier climate, once or twice a year may be sufficient. Safety precautions Be careful when using ladders. Wear protective eyewear and clothing. When working with primers, paints, stains, cleaning solutions, etc., follow all manufacturer's instructions for safe use and disposal. Cleaning How to Clean Glass Avoid cleaning glass while it is in direct sunlight, especially tinted and coated surfaces, to prevent streaking. Start cleaning windows at the top of the building and continue to lower levels. Soak the glass surface with clean water to loosen dirt and debris. Make sure no abrasive particles remain on the glass, then apply an approved cleaning solution with a non-abrasive cloth or other applicator. Quickly remove the cleaning solution with a squeegee, taking care not to allow metal parts of cleaning equipment to touch the glass surface. Avoid any cleaning product that has a strong chemical base or a high alcohol content, as chemical reactions could damage components. Wipe any remaining traces of cleaning solution from glass and other parts of the window and frame. Windows, including their parts and frames, are susceptible to deterioration if left damp. Some windows have an energy panel, often confused with a storm window. An energy panel is a removable, exterior glass panel and can be cleaned in the same way as other parts of the window. Don’t use abrasive cleaning solutions or materials, don’t allow metal parts of cleaning equipment to touch the glass, and don’t use scrapers of any kind. Note: Glass scratched by a scraper is not covered under the Marvin warranty. How to Remove Labels from Glass Labels and adhesive residue should be removed from glass as soon as possible after installation. If a label does not release from the glass easily, use an approved cleaning solution to help remove it. Do not remove labels while exposed to direct sunlight. Do not let cleaning agents come in contact with weatherstrip or finishes, as they could cause damage. How to Clean Screens Carefully remove the screen and lay it on a flat, clean area. Remove any dust by lightly spraying the screen with water from a hose or vacuuming with a soft brush extension. Instead of drying with a cloth, let the screen air-dry completely before reinstalling. For doors, remove and replace screens from the exterior. Approved Cleaners The following cleaners, when used as directed, can be used with Ultrex®: Glass Cleaners Glass Plus® Glass Cleaner Green Works® Original Scent Glass & Surface Cleaner Rain-X® Automotive Glass Cleaner Spray-X® Foaming Glass Cleaner Windex® Glass Cleaner with Ammonia Windex® Original Windex® Powerized Original Zep® Ammonia-Free Concentrate Glass Cleaner Zep® Foaming Glass Cleaner Zep® Streak-Free Glass Cleaner General Purpose Cleaners Amaz Clean & Green™ Water Stain Remover Dawn® Simply Clean, Original Scent (1% in Water) Formula 409® Original Goo Gone® Spray Gel Ivory® Ultra Dishwashing Liquid, Original Scent (1% in Water) Murphy® Oil Soap Liquid Wood Cleaner Soft Scrub® All Purpose Cleaner Lemon Scent Spic and Span® Sun Fresh Multi-Surface Cleaner Tide® Detergent Original Scent Vinegar, Distilled White (5% Acidity) Windex® Multi-Surface Disinfectant Cleaner Zep® Multi-Surface Cleaner Outdoor House Cleaners Home Armor® EZ House Wash™ Home Armor® EZ Deck, Fence & Patio Wash™ Rejuvenate® Outdoor Cleaner Savorgran™ TSP Trisodium Phosphate Spray & Forget™ House and Deck Cleaner Wet & Forget® Moss Mold Mildew and Algae Stain Remover Windex® Hose End Outdoor Multi-Surface Cleaner Zep® All-in-1 Pressure Wash* Zep® House and Siding Pressure Wash Concentrate* *Although overspray of these solutions is safe, never use a pressure washer directly on any part of a window or door. Wood Surfaces How to Maintain Wood Surfaces Remove surface dirt and check the exterior of your wood windows and doors at least once a year to ensure that wood is not exposed to the elements by failing caulk or paint that has cracked, peeled or bubbled. Remove superficial surface dirt by washing painted wood exteriors with water and a soft-bristled, long-handled brush (such as those used for washing cars). A toothbrush works well to remove build-up from cracks and crevasses. Heavier accumulations can be removed with an approved cleaning solution. Other cleaning solutions consisting of alcohol/water mixtures are also effective. Wash from top to bottom to minimize streaking. Use clean water to rinse off detergent solutions or cleaners, which can damage the finish if not removed. Grease or oily substances may require stronger cleaning compounds. Avoid solvents or abrasive cleaners. Don’t let strong detergents, ammonia, chemicals or other harsh cleaning substances get onto finished exterior surfaces, which can be damaged. Nicks and scratches in a painted finish can be touched up with a matching, high-quality latex primer and paint. Contact your local paint supply store for product recommendations and instructions. If you have a brand new, bare wood or primed window or door, you must finish it immediately to prevent possible damage to the wood. Please view Painting and Staining for instructions. How to Paint Wood Surfaces of Marvin Windows and Doors A new Marvin window or door, whether it is primed or bare wood, must be painted immediately to prevent possible damage, even if the window or door is already primed. Primers function to maximize adhesion between the wood and the paint, but do not offer protective qualities. Immediately after installing, clean and dry bare wood surfaces before applying paint or finish. Remove handling marks, debris, or moisture damage by sanding lightly with 220 or 320 grit sandpaper. Paint windows with sash or panels opened (or removed altogether) and do not close (or reinstall) until thoroughly dry. Before painting, apply a strip of masking tape to the edge of the glass, leaving a 1/16” (1.5mm) space between the tape and the wood. This will allow the paint to form a proper seal against the glass. Paints, stains, and varnishes contain solvents that should not come into momentary contact with plastics and vinyl used in weather stripping to avoid damage. Do not apply paint to weatherstrip, vinyl, plastic, metal or any other non-wood parts, which can be damaged by solvents in the finishes. Use a high-quality primer to ensure good paint adhesion. Apply one coat of primer and two coats of high-quality oil-base or latex paint, following the paint manufacturer's instructions. Do not apply paint to any surface which has sliding contact with another surface as this could impact the product’s ability to perform as designed. Do not use cleaners containing abrasives or solvents. Use an approved cleaning solution. High humidity considerations: In addition to Marvin’s General Painting and Staining instructions, products installed in high humidity and high moisture environments should have a paint or finish applied to all accessible wood portions prior to installation. Use paint or finishes of a grade sufficient to protect the units from moisture damage, providing water shedding properties while allowing water vapor to diffuse to the exterior. Units should be painted with operable sash removed. Marvin treats exposed millwork on windows and doors with a water-repellent wood preservative. Cuts or other disturbances to the millwork (during installation or damage over the course of the product’s lifetime), can expose untreated wood to the elements and potential deterioration. Protect untreated wood by applying a water-repellant wood preservative containing at least 0.5% IPBC, following manufacturer’s instructions. Note: Failure to retreat properly or adequately voids warranty. Windows and doors with wood exteriors should be inspected and repainted periodically. Repair any blistering, peeling or cracking in the finish quickly to protect the underlying wood. Caulk any cracks prior to repainting, using a high-quality caulking material or a paintable grade caulking compound. How to Stain Wood Interiors of Marvin Windows and Doors Marvin does not recommend the use of stain or clear coat finishes on exterior surfaces. A new Marvin window or door with bare wood must be stained immediately to prevent possible damage. Clean and dry wood surfaces before applying stain or finish. Remove handling marks, debris, or moisture damage by sanding lightly with 220 or 320 grit sandpaper. Stain windows with sash or panels opened (or removed altogether) and do not close (or reinstall) until thoroughly dry. Before staining, apply a strip of masking tape to the edge of the glass, leaving a 1/16” (1.5mm) space between the tape and the wood. This will allow the finish to form a proper seal against the glass. Paints, stains, and varnishes contain solvents that should not come into contact with plastics and vinyl used in weather stripping to avoid damage. Do not apply stain to weatherstrip, vinyl, plastic, metal or any other non-wood parts that can be damaged by solvents in the finishes. Do not apply stain to any surface which has sliding contact with another surface. It could impact the product’s ability to perform as designed. Do not use cleaners containing abrasives or solvents. Use an approved cleaning solution. High humidity considerations: In addition to Marvin’s General Painting and Staining instructions, products installed in high humidity and high moisture environments should have a paint or finish applied to all accessible wood portions prior to installation. Use stain or finishes of a grade sufficient to protect the units from moisture damage, providing water shedding properties while allowing water vapor to diffuse to the exterior. Marvin recommends following stain manufacturer recommendations, including following with at at least 2 coats of clear polyurethane finish. Marvin treats exposed millwork on windows and doors with a water-repellent wood preservative. Cuts or other disturbances to the millwork (during installation or damage over the course of the product’s lifetime), can expose untreated wood to the elements and potential deterioration. Protect untreated wood by applying a water-repellant wood preservative containing at least 0.5% IPBC, following manufacturer’s instructions. Note: Failure to retreat properly or adequately voids warranty. Caulk any cracks prior to refinishing, using a high-quality caulking material or a paintable grade caulking compound.

The lower the emissivity the higher the percentage of long-wave radiation blocked thereby improving thermal performance. Low E glass is coated with a thin microscopic, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layer. The primary function is to reduce the U-value by suppressing radiative heat flow. A secondary feature is the blocking of short wave radiation to impede heat gain. There are two basic types of Low E glass. The first, vacuum or sputter coated Low E, is referred to as soft-coat (See Low E II definition). The second is pyrolytic Low E, commonly referred to as hard-coat. (See pyrolytic definition.) Low E II Glass A high performance Low E glass, providing the best winter U-value and warmest center glass. It offers significant improvement in reducing solar heat gain coefficient values, providing customers one of the coolest summer glass temperatures of all Low E products. Additionally, ultraviolet light transmission is greatly reduced. The Low E II coated glass products are specifically designed for insulating glass units normally as a second surface coating. See Low E and pyrolitic definitions. M Magnum A Marvin trade name for heavily constructed window products which are designed for applications where a heavy duty product is necessary.
